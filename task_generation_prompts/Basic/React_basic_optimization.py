# React + TypeScript Optimization Task Requirements

## GOAL
As a technical architect super experienced in React and TypeScript, you are given real-world scenarios and proficiency levels for React development. Your job is to generate an entire task definition, including TypeScript code files, README.md, expected outcomes, etc., that can be effectively used to assess the candidate's ability to effectively think, design, build, implement, debug, or in general solve a problem end to end.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Nature of the Task
- Task must ask to optimize existing TypeScript React code
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are historically accurate and relevant to the context
- **Time Constraint**: Each task MUST be completable within 30 minutes by a candidate with BASIC proficiency (1-2 years React experience)

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FULLY FUNCTIONAL STARTER CODE

**TYPESCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALL code files MUST use TypeScript** (.tsx for components, .ts for utilities)
- **MUST include a valid tsconfig.json** with proper React and TypeScript configurations
- **MUST include proper type definitions** for props, state, API responses, and function parameters
- **Basic TypeScript features MUST be implemented**: interfaces, types, type annotations, return types
- **NO TypeScript errors** - The application must compile without any type errors
- **NO 'any' types** - All types must be properly defined (components, functions, API responses, event handlers)
- **Package.json MUST include TypeScript dependencies**: typescript, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/node

**FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **The starter code MUST be a complete, working React + TypeScript application** that runs successfully immediately after `npm install` and `npm start`
- **ZERO compilation errors, ZERO TypeScript errors, ZERO runtime errors, ZERO warnings**
- **All UI must render correctly** - Every component, page, and UI element must display properly
- **All existing functionality must work** - API calls execute, data loads and displays, user interactions work, forms submit
- **The candidate should NOT need to fix anything to make the app run** - The app is already fully functional

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UNOPTIMIZED CODE:**
- **DO NOT include ANY performance optimizations** - NO React.memo, NO useMemo, NO useCallback, NO request caching, NO request batching, NO debouncing, NO throttling, NO virtualization, NO lazy loading, NO code splitting
- **The code must be intentionally inefficient but functionally correct** - Perfect functionality but poor performance under load
- **The candidate's task is ONLY to optimize the working application** - Identify bottlenecks and implement optimizations, NOT fix broken functionality

### Task Complexity Requirements

**SCOPE FOR 30-MINUTE COMPLETION:**
- Task must be achievable within 30 minutes by a BASIC level candidate
- Focus on 2-3 specific optimization areas maximum
- Provide a working application with clear, identifiable performance issues
- Optimization should focus on fundamental React patterns, not complex architectural changes
- Examples of appropriate 30-minute optimizations:
  - Reduce unnecessary re-renders in a component tree (3-5 components)
  - Implement basic memoization for expensive computations
  - Optimize data fetching to reduce redundant API calls
  - Add request deduplication for concurrent identical requests
  - Implement basic virtualization for a single list component
  - Add proper React.memo usage to prevent cascading updates

**INAPPROPRIATE FOR 30-MINUTE TASKS:**
- Complete application architecture redesign
- Implementing complex state management solutions (Redux, Zustand)
- Building comprehensive caching layers
- Multiple simultaneous optimization areas requiring deep analysis
- Complex TypeScript refactoring or advanced type system features
- Building custom hooks frameworks or complex abstractions

### Starter Code Requirements

**WHAT MUST BE INCLUDED:**
- Complete React + TypeScript project structure (standard Create React App with TypeScript template)
- **Valid tsconfig.json** with proper compiler options for React
- **Valid package.json** with all TypeScript dependencies and development scripts
- All files using TypeScript extensions (.tsx, .ts)
- Proper type definitions for all components, props, state, and functions
- Basic TypeScript features properly implemented (interfaces, types, type annotations)
- Working components with complete TypeScript implementation
- Functional API calls with properly typed responses
- Working state management with proper TypeScript types
- All necessary imports and exports with correct types
- Valid TSX syntax throughout
- **All standard development scripts**: start, build, test, eject

**WHAT MUST NOT BE INCLUDED:**
- **NO optimization techniques**: NO React.memo, NO useMemo, NO useCallback
- **NO efficient patterns**: NO caching, NO deduplication, NO batching, NO debouncing, NO throttling
- **NO performance enhancements**: NO virtualization, NO lazy loading, NO code splitting
- **NO comments of any kind**: NO TODO, NO hints, NO "optimize this", NO placeholder comments
- **NO advanced TypeScript patterns**: Focus on basic types, interfaces, and annotations only

### AI and External Resource Policy
- Candidates are permitted to use external resources including AI tools, documentation, Stack Overflow
- Tasks assess ability to find, understand, integrate, and adapt solutions
- Complexity should require genuine problem-solving beyond simple copy-pasting

### Code Generation Instructions
Based on real-world scenarios, create a React + TypeScript task that:
- Draws inspiration from input scenarios for business context
- Matches BASIC proficiency level (1-2 years React + TypeScript experience)
- **Can be completed within 30 minutes**
- Tests practical React + TypeScript optimization skills
- Focuses on fundamental concepts with clear, measurable performance issues
- Task name: short, descriptive, under 50 characters, kebab-case (e.g., "react-ts-dashboard-optimization")

## README.md STRUCTURE (React + TypeScript Optimization)

### Task Overview (MANDATORY - 2-3 substantial sentences)

**CRITICAL**: Describe the specific business scenario where a React + TypeScript application is experiencing performance issues. Explain that the application is fully functional and type-safe, but suffers from performance problems under load (e.g., unnecessary re-renders, redundant API calls, slow UI updates). Connect the business problem (real-time dashboard, analytics UI, high-traffic SaaS) to the need for optimization. Make clear this is a **30-minute optimization task** focusing on specific, achievable improvements.

### Helpful Tips

Practical guidance without revealing implementations:

- Consider how React's rendering cycle impacts performance
- Think about when components unnecessarily re-render
- Review how API calls are triggered and if they're duplicated
- Consider TypeScript's role in maintaining type safety during optimization
- Explore React's built-in optimization hooks
- Think about data flow and prop passing patterns
- Review browser DevTools for performance profiling
- Consider component composition and responsibility separation
- Use bullet points starting with "Consider", "Think about", "Explore", "Review"

**CRITICAL**: Guide discovery, never provide direct solutions

### Objectives

Define goals focusing on outcomes for a 30-minute optimization task:

- Reduce unnecessary component re-renders in the application
- Optimize API call patterns to eliminate redundancy
- Improve UI responsiveness under typical load conditions
- Maintain TypeScript type safety while implementing optimizations
- Apply React performance best practices to critical rendering paths
- Measure and verify performance improvements

**CRITICAL**: Scope should be achievable in 30 minutes

### How to Verify

Verification approaches for 30-minute optimizations:

- Use React DevTools Profiler to measure render frequency before and after
- Monitor network tab to verify reduced API call count
- Interact with UI elements and observe responsiveness improvements
- Confirm TypeScript compilation remains error-free
- Verify all existing functionality still works correctly
- Check console for any new warnings or errors
- Measure specific metrics (e.g., render count, API call count) before/after

**CRITICAL**: Focus on measurable, verifiable improvements

### NOT TO INCLUDE:
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Exact code solutions
- Configuration examples
- Specific library recommendations beyond React built-ins
- Complex architectural patterns
- Phrases like "you should implement", "add the following code"
