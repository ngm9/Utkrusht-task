Let me provide you with some context about the company and role:

Company Context:
{organization_background}

Roles and Responsibilities:
{role_context}
A backend software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Go (Golang) and Redis is expected to build small-scale backend services and integrate them with Redis for caching or lightweight data storage. Their main responsibility is to understand existing application logic, implement simple API endpoints in Go, and use Redis to handle temporary data or key-value storage. They should be able to write clean, idiomatic Go code, use packages like `net/http` or frameworks such as Gin/Fiber for REST APIs, and connect to Redis using a client library (e.g., go-redis). The candidate is not required to design complex architectures or advanced caching layers but should understand basic Redis operations, error handling, and running both Go and Redis locally for testing.

Based on this information, could you summarize what you understand about the company and role requirements?

# GOAL:
As a technical architect experienced in Redis caching and Golang integration, you are given a list of real world scenarios and proficiency levels for Redis. 
Your job is to generate a task, with the given specifications, so that a candidate is presented with a functional API with Redis integration but with basic logical bugs, missing implementations, or simple performance issues that require basic-level Redis optimization skills.
The candidate's responsibility is to identify the issue and fix it. So you'll have to be careful about not giving away the solution or even hinting at it in your task definitions.

# CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION PHILOSOPHY:

**DEPLOYMENT SETUP REQUIREMENTS:**
This is the MOST CRITICAL aspect of basic-level task generation. The task generation must follow this exact pattern:

1. **WORKING BUT BROKEN DEPLOYMENT**: 
   - Generate files that will successfully deploy and run using run.sh
   - The API must start without errors and be accessible
   - Redis connection must be established successfully
   - All endpoints must be reachable and respond (even if slowly or incorrectly)
   - The application should NOT crash or fail to start

2. **PROBLEMS EXIST IN IMPLEMENTATION**:
   - The deployed application has basic Redis caching issues (missing caching, wrong data types, no TTL, inefficient patterns)
   - Some endpoints are slow because caching is not implemented
   - Some endpoints return stale data because cache invalidation is missing
   - Some endpoints don't use Redis at all when they should
   - Basic mistakes like wrong Redis commands, improper key names, or missing connection pooling
   - The issues are FUNCTIONAL - the code runs but performs poorly or incorrectly

3. **CANDIDATE RECEIVES WORKING ENVIRONMENT**:
   - Candidate gets a fully deployed environment with API running and Redis connected
   - They DO NOT need to fix deployment issues or Docker problems
   - They DO NOT need to troubleshoot connection failures
   - They ONLY need to refactor/optimize the caching implementation in the code
   - The basic setup is given - candidate focuses on improving the caching logic

4. **WHAT CANDIDATE MUST DO**:
   - Analyze the running application and identify basic caching issues
   - Add missing Redis caching where needed
   - Fix incorrect Redis usage patterns
   - Implement proper TTL strategies
   - Add basic cache invalidation logic
   - Optimize simple caching patterns
   - Refactor code to follow basic Redis best practices

**SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**:
- **run.sh + docker-compose.yml**: These MUST work perfectly and deploy without issues
- **Golang application code**: This is where the basic problems exist and need optimization
- Deployment = Working ✓
- Implementation = Needs fixing by candidate ✗

This separation ensures candidates focus on Redis optimization skills rather than debugging deployment issues.

# CONTEXT & CANDIDATE EXPECTATION:
The candidate will receive a FULLY DEPLOYED and RUNNING Golang REST API application that is already connected to Redis cache. The Golang application includes:
- Complete REST API endpoints that are accessible and responding
- Working Redis connection (no connection errors)
- All necessary basic structure and configuration
- Simple API structs and response formatting
- Pre-configured Redis that is running and accessible
- Basic caching implementation with simple mistakes, missing features, or inefficient patterns that require basic-level fixes

The candidate's responsibility is to identify and fix basic Redis caching issues in the code and improve the implementation. A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement basic Redis caching best practices at an entry level (1-2 years experience).

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## Nature of the task 
- Task name MUST be within 50 words and clearly describe the basic-level Redis optimization scenario
- Task must provide a WORKING and DEPLOYED application with basic Redis implementation issues requiring basic-level optimization skills
- **CRITICAL**: The Golang application should be FULLY DEPLOYED, RUNNING, and ACCESSIBLE but performing poorly or incorrectly due to basic Redis caching mistakes that require simple fixes
- **CRITICAL**: The deployment infrastructure (Docker, docker-compose, run.sh) MUST work perfectly without any errors. All deployment issues must be resolved in the generated files. The ONLY problems should be in the application code's Redis implementation.
- **CRITICAL**: The exact problem described in the task scenario MUST be perfectly replicated in the code files. For example, if the scenario mentions "endpoint X is slow because caching is missing", the actual code MUST have endpoint X without any caching. If it mentions "stale data because cache is never cleared", the code MUST have caching without any invalidation logic. The candidate should ONLY need to fix/add the caching implementation, NOT debug deployment.
- **CRITICAL**: Candidates must understand that fixing Redis caching issues means modifying the Golang application code. The task should make it clear that they need to add missing caching, fix incorrect Redis usage, implement TTL strategies, and add cache invalidation in the application endpoints.
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are relevant to the context. 
- Generate a complete, DEPLOYED and RUNNING Golang REST API application with Redis that has basic implementation issues according to the task requirements suitable for basic-level engineers (1-2 years experience).
- **PROVIDE BASIC PROBLEMATIC REDIS IMPLEMENTATION**: Include code with simple caching mistakes such as:
  - Missing caching on endpoints that should be cached
  - Using wrong Redis data types (storing complex objects as strings instead of hashes)
  - No TTL set on cached data
  - Basic key naming issues (not following conventions)
  - Missing cache invalidation on data updates
  - No error handling for Redis operations
  - Fetching from database even when cache exists
  - Inefficient get/set patterns (multiple calls instead of single operation)
  - Not using connection pooling properly
  - Not closing Redis connections properly
- The question should be a real-world business scenario requiring basic-level Redis caching implementation and simple optimization, NOT building from scratch.
- The complexity of the optimization task and specific improvements expected from the candidate must align with basic proficiency level (1-2 years experience) requiring fundamental Redis skills including:
  - Adding basic caching to endpoints
  - Setting appropriate TTL values
  - Implementing simple cache invalidation
  - Using correct Redis data types (strings, hashes)
  - Following basic key naming conventions
  - Adding basic error handling for Redis operations
  - Understanding cache-aside pattern
  - Implementing simple get/set operations
  - Basic connection handling
- The question must NOT include hints about the specific fixes needed. The hints will be provided in the "hints" field.
- Ensure that all questions and scenarios adhere to basic Redis practices suitable for entry-level developers.
- If you include diagrams, ensure they are written in mermaid format, properly indented and also in code blocks.

## AI AND EXTERNAL RESOURCE POLICY:
- Candidates are permitted and encouraged to use any external resources they find helpful, including but not limited to Google, Stack Overflow, Redis documentation, and AI-powered tools, agentic IDs, or Large Language Models (LLMs). 
- The tasks are designed to assess the candidate's ability to effectively implement and fix basic Redis caching patterns at an entry level, rather than testing rote memorization. Therefore, the complexity of the tasks should require genuine understanding of basic Redis concepts and practical implementation skills.
- Tasks should involve straightforward caching challenges that test fundamental Redis knowledge.
- Candidates will be encouraged to use AI to help with boilerplate code and learning Redis commands, but they must understand the basic caching concepts.

## Code Generation Instructions:
Based on the real-world scenarios provided above, create a Redis optimization task that:
- Draws inspiration from the input_scenarios given below to determine the business context and technical requirements
- **CRITICAL**: The scenario description MUST be perfectly replicated in the actual code files. Every missing caching implementation, incorrect usage, or basic mistake mentioned in the scenario MUST exist in the generated code exactly as described.
- **CRITICAL**: The deployment MUST work perfectly. All Docker, docker-compose, and run.sh files must be error-free and result in a running application. Test mentally that the deployment would succeed.
- Matches the complexity level appropriate for basic proficiency level (1-2 years experience), keeping in mind that AI assistance is allowed but should not diminish the need for basic Redis implementation skills.
- Tests practical basic-level Redis caching implementation skills that require understanding of fundamental caching concepts.
- Time constraints: Each task should be finished within {minutes_range} minutes.
- At every time pick different real-world scenario from the list provided to ensure variety in task generation.
- **CRITICAL**: The Golang application should be COMPLETE, DEPLOYED, and RUNNING with all endpoints accessible, but with basic Redis implementation issues that need simple fixes.
- The Redis connection setup should work without errors.
- All REST API routes should be implemented and accessible but with missing or incorrect basic caching patterns.
- Redis should be running and accessible with proper configuration.
- The code files generated must be valid, deploy successfully, and run without crashes, but have basic caching implementation issues.
- **CRITICAL**: The task focuses on fixing existing basic caching implementation issues and adding missing simple caching, NOT building from scratch or debugging deployment.
- For BASIC level proficiency: Use go-redis/redis/v9 library with simple Get/Set operations and basic patterns.

## Infrastructure Requirements:
- MUST include a complete, fully functional REST API structure using Golang with popular frameworks like Gin or standard net/http that connects to Redis
- MUST include a Dockerfile for the Golang application that builds without errors
- A run.sh which has the end-to-end responsibility of deploying the infrastructure successfully
- A docker-compose.yml file which contains all the applications — a docker for running the Golang REST API and a docker for running the Redis cache
- **CRITICAL - DEPLOYMENT MUST BE PERFECT**: The infrastructure setup MUST be fully automated and work without any errors. Candidates should receive a running application, NOT a broken deployment.
- **CRITICAL**: All deployment files (run.sh, docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile) must be thoroughly validated to ensure successful deployment

### Docker-compose Instructions:
  - Redis service with proper working configuration (port 6379, proper image)
  - Golang API service with working dependency on Redis using depends_on
  - Proper network configuration for service communication
  - **MUST NOT include any version specification** in the docker-compose.yml file
  - **MUST NOT include environment variables or .env file references**
  - Use hardcoded configuration values instead of environment variables
  - **CRITICAL**: Golang service MUST start successfully and be accessible
  - **CRITICAL**: Redis service MUST start successfully and be connectable
  - **TESTING REQUIREMENT**: Mentally verify that this docker-compose configuration will result in both services running successfully

### Redis Configuration Instructions:
- Redis should be configured with working default settings
- Redis MUST be accessible from the Golang application
- Connection MUST succeed without errors
- May include some sample data for testing

### Run.sh Instructions:
  + PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY: Starts Docker containers using `docker-compose up -d` and ensures successful deployment
  + **CRITICAL**: This script MUST work perfectly without any errors
  + WAIT MECHANISM: Implements proper health check to wait for Redis service to be fully ready and accepting connections
  + VALIDATION: Validates that Golang application is responding and connected to Redis successfully
  + DATA INITIALIZATION: May populate some initial test data in Redis
  + MONITORING: Monitors container status and provides feedback on successful deployment
  + ERROR HANDLING: Includes proper error handling but should not encounter errors in normal execution
  + LOCATION: All files are located in /root/task directory, ensure Docker paths reference this location
  + **SUCCESS CONFIRMATION**: Script should clearly indicate successful deployment completion

## kill.sh file instructions:
- Purpose: The script must completely clean up everything related to the `task` project that was created using run.sh, docker-compose.yml, and Dockerfile.  
- Instructions:
  1. Stop and remove all containers created by docker-compose.
  2. Remove all associated Docker volumes (Redis volume, any named volumes, and anonymous volumes).
  3. Remove all Docker networks created for the task.
  4. Force-remove all Docker images related to this task (<image_name> and redis:7-alpine).
  5. Run `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` to remove any dangling containers, images, networks, and volumes that are not in use.
  6. Delete the entire `/root/task/` folder where all the files were created, so that no project files remain.
  7. The script should ignore errors if some resources are already removed (use `|| true` where necessary).
  8. Print logs at every step (e.g., "Stopping containers...", "Removing images...", "Deleting folder...") so the user knows what is happening.
  9. After successful cleanup, print a final message like "Cleanup completed successfully! Droplet is now clean."

- Commands that should be included:
  - `docker-compose -f /root/task/docker-compose.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans || true`
  - `docker system prune -a --volumes -f`
  - `docker rmi -f $(docker images -q | grep -E 'docker_image_name|redis:7-alpine' || true) || true`
  - `rm -rf /root/task`

- Dependencies cleanup:
  - Ensure that any Go build artifacts, binaries, and mod cache are removed from `/root/task/`.
  - Remove all Redis data directories that were mounted via volumes.
  - Ensure that both the custom application container and the Redis container are cleaned up.

- Extra instruction:
  - The script should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times without errors).
  - Always use `set -e` at the top to exit on error (except when explicitly ignored).

### Dockerfile Instructions:
  - MUST generate a complete, valid Dockerfile for the Golang application
  - **CRITICAL**: Dockerfile MUST build successfully without errors
  - Should use appropriate Golang base image (golang:1.21-alpine or similar for build, alpine for runtime in multi-stage builds)
  - Should use multi-stage builds for optimal image size (build stage and runtime stage)
  - Should copy go.mod and go.sum first for better caching, then source code
  - Should run `go mod download` to install dependencies
  - Should build the Golang binary using `go build` command
  - Should expose appropriate port for the API (typically 8080)
  - Should include proper working directory set to /root/task
  - Should include proper entry point that runs the compiled binary
  - Must follow Docker best practices for Golang applications
  - **DO NOT use environment variables or .env files**
  - **CRITICAL**: Set WORKDIR to /root/task to match the file location
  - **VALIDATION**: Ensure all COPY commands reference correct file paths

**CRITICAL**: All Docker and script references must account for the /root/task base directory and must result in successful deployment.

The output should be a valid json schema with proper file structure.

## Code file requirements:
- Multiple files will be generated and must be included in the JSON structure correctly
- Code should follow Golang best practices and idiomatic Go style with basic Redis caching mistakes or missing implementations
- **CRITICAL**: The Golang application files MUST be complete and fully functional with all endpoints accessible, Redis connection working, but with basic caching implementation issues
- **CRITICAL**: The exact problems described in the task scenario MUST be present in the code. Do not implement optimized solutions - implement the problematic or missing code exactly as described in the scenario
- **CRITICAL**: Deployment files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, run.sh) MUST be perfect and work without errors
- Redis connection setup should work correctly without connection errors
- API routes should be accessible but with missing or incorrect basic caching
- Tasks should focus on fixing existing basic caching issues and adding missing simple caching implementations
- **SEPARATION OF CONCERNS**: 
  - docker-compose.yml: MUST work perfectly ✓
  - run.sh: MUST deploy successfully ✓
  - Dockerfile: MUST build without errors ✓
  - Golang app: Should run but have basic redis implementation issues that need fixing ✗
- DO NOT include any 'TODO' or placeholder comments in Golang code
- DO NOT include any comments that give away optimization solutions
- DO NOT include any comments that hint at the solution in the files
- DO NOT to include anu kind of the comments in the code files
- The Golang application should be immediately runnable and accessible but will perform poorly or incorrectly until candidate fixes basic caching issues
- **BASIC REDIS ISSUES**: Existing caching implementation needs basic fixes - code contains missing caching or incorrect usage requiring entry-level solutions
- **FILE LOCATION**: All code and scripts must reference /root/task as the base directory
- Use proper Golang package structure with meaningful package names

## .gitignore INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a comprehensive .gitignore file suitable for Redis and Golang development tasks that includes:
- Go build artifacts and binaries
- Go module cache (go.sum should be committed, but exclude vendor/ if used)
- IDE and editor files (.vscode/, .idea/, .DS_Store)
- Log files (*.log)
- Redis dump files (dump.rdb, appendonly.aof)

1. The business context and what the application does
2. The current performance or functionality problems users are experiencing
3. The impact on business operations or user experience
4. What needs to be improved

NEVER generate empty content - always provide substantial business context that explains the problem from a user/business perspective.
