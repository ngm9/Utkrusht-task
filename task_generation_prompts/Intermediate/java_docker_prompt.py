- Instructions:
  1. Stop and remove all containers created by docker-compose
  2. Remove all associated Docker volumes
  3. Remove all Docker networks created for the task
  4. Force-remove all Docker images related to this task
  5. Run `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` to remove any dangling containers, images, networks, and volumes
  6. Delete the entire `/root/task/` folder where all the files were created
  7. The script should ignore errors if some resources are already removed (use `|| true` where necessary)

- Java compiled files (*.class, *.jar, *.war)
- Log files (*.log, logs/)
- Docker volumes and data directories
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- Any other standard exclusions for Java/Spring Boot/Docker development

## .dockerignore INSTRUCTIONS:

## README.md INSTRUCTIONS:
 - The README.md contains the following sections:
   - Task Overview
   - Helpful Tips
   - Application Access
   - Objectives
   - How to Verify 
- The README.md file content MUST be fully populated with meaningful, specific content relevant to intermediate-level Docker containerization and deployment
- Task Overview section MUST contain the exact business scenario and Docker containerization requirements
- ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed
- Content must be directly relevant to the specific Docker containerization scenario being generated
- Use concrete business context explaining why proper Docker setup is critical
- **CRITICAL**: Emphasize Docker containerization, optimization, and deployment throughout README
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT directly tell candidates what to implement - provide direction and guidance to help them discover solutions

### Task Overview

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This section MUST contain 2-3 meaningful sentences describing the business scenario and the Docker containerization requirements. The Java application is already functional and optimized; the focus is on creating production-ready Docker containers.
NEVER generate empty content - always provide substantial business context that explains why proper Docker containerization is critical for deployment.

### Helpful Tips
Provide practical guidance without revealing specific implementations:
  - Suggest considering how container images can be built more efficiently using staged approaches
  - Mention thinking about what files are actually needed in the final container image
  - Hint at exploring different base image options and their trade-offs for production deployments
  - Recommend considering resource boundaries to prevent containers from consuming excessive system resources
  - Suggest thinking about how containers communicate and whether network isolation is properly configured
  - Point toward considering data persistence strategies when containers restart
  - Hint at exploring container lifecycle management and how to detect when services are truly ready
  - Recommend reviewing security implications of default container configurations
  - Suggest analyzing build cache behavior and how layer ordering affects rebuild times
  - Mention considering logging and monitoring approaches for containerized applications
  - Use bullet points formatted as tips, starting with action words like "Consider", "Think about", "Explore", "Review"
  - **CRITICAL**: Tips should guide discovery, not provide direct solutions or specific commands

### Application Access
  - Provide the application access details (host, port, API endpoints)
  - Mention available monitoring endpoints (health, metrics if applicable)
  - For the host, use a placeholder indicating the droplet IP (e.g., <DROPLET_IP>)
  - Mention Docker commands for inspecting containers (docker stats, docker logs, docker inspect)
  - Emphasize Docker monitoring and optimization tools

### Objectives
Define clear goals that guide candidates toward solutions without explicitly stating implementations:
  - Frame objectives around outcomes rather than specific technical implementations
  - Focus on what the system should achieve, not how to achieve it
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Reduce container image footprint to improve deployment speed and resource utilization"
    * "Ensure containers restart automatically when failures occur without manual intervention"
    * "Implement health verification mechanisms so orchestration tools know when services are ready"
    * "Configure appropriate resource boundaries to prevent individual containers from affecting system stability"
    * "Establish proper isolation between services while enabling necessary communication"
    * "Minimize build times by optimizing how dependencies and artifacts are cached"
    * "Apply security hardening to reduce the container attack surface"
  - Objectives should be measurable but not prescribe specific Docker features or commands
  - Should guide candidates to think about: efficiency, reliability, security, scalability, observability
  - **CRITICAL**: Objectives describe the "what" and "why", never the "how"
  - Avoid phrases like "implement multi-stage builds" or "create health checks" - instead describe the desired outcome

### How to Verify
Provide verification approaches that help candidates validate their solutions without giving away implementation details:
  - Frame verification in terms of observable outcomes and system behaviors
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Compare the final container size against the initial baseline to measure optimization gains"
    * "Observe container behavior during restart scenarios to ensure recovery mechanisms work correctly"
    * "Monitor startup sequences to confirm services signal readiness only when fully operational"
    * "Test resource consumption under load to verify boundaries are properly enforced"
    * "Examine container logs and metrics to ensure visibility into application behavior"
    * "Perform clean builds to validate that caching strategies reduce rebuild times"
    * "Inspect running containers to confirm security configurations are applied"
  - Suggest using Docker inspection commands without specifying exact syntax
  - Mention metrics and behaviors to observe rather than specific tools or configurations
  - Guide candidates to test edge cases: concurrent access, failures, restarts, resource pressure
  - **CRITICAL**: Describe what to verify and why it matters, not the specific implementation to check
  - Avoid phrases like "verify health check is configured" - instead describe expected system behavior

### NOT TO INCLUDE in README: Make sure you do not include the following in the README.md file:
  - MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS (environment is automated via run.sh)
  - Step-by-step setup instructions (deployment is automated)
  - Instructions to run the run.sh file (deployment is automated)
  - Specific Docker solutions or commands (e.g., "use multi-stage builds", "add HEALTHCHECK directive")
  - Direct implementation hints (e.g., "create a .dockerignore file", "use Alpine base image")
  - Java optimization instructions (Java code is already optimized)
  - Explicit technology choices (let candidates decide the approach)
  - Code snippets or configuration examples
  - Phrases like "you should implement", "make sure to add", "configure the following"
