# GOAL:
As a database architect super experienced in PostgreSQL, you are given a list of real world scenarios and proficiency levels for PostgreSQL. 
Your job is to generate a task, with the given specifications, so that a candidate is presented with a functional database with initial schema and data but either with logical bugs or performance issues that require intermediate-level database optimization skills.
The candidate's responsibility is to identify the database issues and fix them directly in PostgreSQL. You must be careful about not giving away the solution or even hinting at it in your task definitions.

# CONTEXT & CANDIDATE EXPECTATION:
The candidate will receive a FULLY FUNCTIONAL PostgreSQL database that is already deployed with existing schema and data. The database includes:
- Pre-populated tables with realistic data
- Intentionally complex inefficient queries, missing indexes, or suboptimal schema design
- Performance bottlenecks that demand intermediate-level problem-solving (3-5 years experience)
- Real-world business scenarios requiring database optimization

The candidate's responsibility is to analyze the database, identify performance issues, and implement PostgreSQL optimizations directly using SQL commands, psql, or any database client tool of their choice.

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## Nature of the task 
- Task name MUST be within 50 words and clearly describe the intermediate-level optimization scenario
- Task must provide a working database with existing schema, data, and intentionally suboptimal design requiring intermediate-level optimization skills
- **CRITICAL**: The PostgreSQL database should be FULLY populated and functional but performing poorly due to complex database inefficiencies that require sophisticated analysis and optimization techniques
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are historically accurate and relevant to the context
- Generate a complete, working PostgreSQL database that has performance issues according to the task requirements suitable for intermediate-level engineers (3-5 years experience)
- **PROVIDE COMPLEX PROBLEMATIC DATABASE DESIGN**: Include init_database.sql with multiple inefficient table structures AND missing complex indexes AND poor relationships AND suboptimal data models that require comprehensive analysis and multi-layered optimization approaches
- The question should be a real-world business scenario requiring intermediate-level database performance optimization involving multiple tables, complex queries, and advanced optimization strategies
- The complexity of the optimization task and specific improvements expected from the candidate must align with intermediate proficiency level (3-5 years experience) requiring advanced database optimization techniques including:
  - Complex query optimization with joins across multiple tables
  - Advanced indexing strategies (composite indexes, partial indexes, covering indexes, GiST, GIN indexes)
  - Query plan analysis and interpretation using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
  - Database relationship improvements and normalization/denormalization strategies
  - Performance bottleneck identification in multi-table operations
  - Advanced PostgreSQL features utilization (materialized views, CTEs, window functions)
  - Complex WHERE clause optimization
  - Subquery and CTE optimization
  - Connection pooling configuration and optimization
  - Vacuum and analyze strategies
  - Table partitioning for large datasets
  - Database statistics and configuration tuning
- The question must NOT include hints about the specific optimizations needed. The hints will be provided in the "hints" field
- Ensure that all questions and scenarios adhere to the latest PostgreSQL best practices and versions for intermediate-level optimization
- If you include diagrams, ensure they are written in mermaid format, properly indented and also in code blocks

## AI AND EXTERNAL RESOURCE POLICY:
- Candidates are permitted and encouraged to use any external resources they find helpful, including but not limited to Google, Stack Overflow, PostgreSQL documentation, and AI-powered tools, agentic IDs, or Large Language Models (LLMs)
- The tasks are designed to assess the candidate's ability to effectively analyze, diagnose, and optimize complex PostgreSQL performance issues at an intermediate level, rather than testing rote memorization
- Therefore, the complexity of the optimization tasks should require genuine intermediate-level database performance engineering and advanced problem-solving skills that go beyond simple copy-pasting from a generative AI
- Tasks should involve multi-layered optimization challenges that require understanding of database internals, query execution plans, and advanced PostgreSQL features
- Candidates will be encouraged to use AI to help with query optimization and analysis but not replace their own thinking and diagnostic skills

## Database Generation Instructions:
Based on the real-world scenarios provided, create a PostgreSQL optimization task that:
- Draws inspiration from the input_scenarios given below to determine the business context and technical requirements
- Matches the complexity level appropriate for intermediate proficiency level (3-5 years experience), keeping in mind that AI assistance is allowed but should not diminish the need for advanced database optimization skills
- Tests practical intermediate-level PostgreSQL query optimization and performance tuning skills that require deep understanding of database internals, query execution plans, and advanced optimization principles
- Time constraints: Each task should be finished within {minutes_range} minutes
- At every time pick different real-world scenario from the list provided to ensure variety in task generation
- **CRITICAL**: The PostgreSQL database should be COMPLETE and FULLY POPULATED with realistic data, but with intentionally complex inefficient schema, missing indexes, and poor query performance requiring intermediate-level optimization
- The database should contain multiple tables with relationships, realistic data volumes (thousands to hundreds of thousands of rows), and complex queries that expose performance issues
- Include sample queries in the documentation that demonstrate the performance problems (slow execution times)
- The database should have clear performance bottlenecks that can be measured and improved
- **CRITICAL**: The task focuses on optimizing existing poorly performing database design and queries, NOT building from scratch

## Infrastructure Requirements:
- MUST include a complete PostgreSQL database deployment using Docker
- A run.sh which has the end-to-end responsibility of deploying the database infrastructure
- A docker-compose.yml file which contains the PostgreSQL database service
- **IMPORTANT**: The infrastructure setup is AUTOMATED - candidates will NOT manually deploy or run scripts. The task environment will be pre-deployed with working database connection

### Docker-compose Instructions:
  - PostgreSQL service with proper configuration (database, username, password)
  - Database creation with User and Password is mandatory
  - Volume mounts for data persistence (PostgreSQL data directory)
  - **Volume mount for SQL files** - Mount the SQL files directory to PostgreSQL container for initialization
  - Network configuration if needed for external access
  - **MUST NOT include any version specification** in the docker-compose.yml file
  - **MUST NOT include environment variables or .env file references**
  - Use hardcoded configuration values instead of environment variables
  - For user and password, use hardcoded values in the docker-compose.yml file
  - **INITIALIZATION APPROACH**: Use PostgreSQL's built-in initialization by mounting SQL files to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` in the PostgreSQL container
  - Expose PostgreSQL port for external client connections (5432)
  - **CRITICAL**: Docker-compose handles container orchestration AND database initialization through volume mounts

### init_database.sql instructions:
- Create a comprehensive database schema with multiple tables (minimum 5-8 tables for intermediate level)
- Include realistic relationships between tables (foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- **CRITICAL: Do not implement the solution in the SQL files, create complex schema with multiple performance issues that require sophisticated analysis and multi-layered optimization approaches suitable for intermediate-level candidates**
- Include intentional performance problems such as:
  - Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
  - Missing composite indexes for multi-column queries
  - Inefficient data types (e.g., VARCHAR instead of TEXT, or vice versa)
  - Poor normalization or over-normalization
  - Missing foreign key indexes
  - Tables without primary keys or using inefficient primary keys
  - No partitioning on large tables that would benefit from it
  - Missing constraints that could help query optimization
- Populate tables with realistic data volumes:
  - Smaller lookup tables: hundreds to thousands of rows
  - Main transactional tables: tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of rows
  - Use realistic data distributions that expose performance issues
- Include comments in the SQL file that describe the business context but NOT the optimization solutions
- Data should be complex enough to make performance issues evident when querying

### Run.sh Instructions:
  - PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY: Starts Docker containers using `docker-compose up -d`
  - WAIT MECHANISM: Implements proper health check to wait for PostgreSQL service to be fully ready and accepting connections
  - VALIDATION: Validates that PostgreSQL database is responding and accessible
  - DATABASE SETUP: SQL files are automatically executed by PostgreSQL container during initialization (no manual SQL execution needed)
  - MONITORING: Monitors container status and provides feedback on successful deployment
  - ERROR HANDLING: Includes proper error handling for failed container starts or database connection issues
  - SIMPLIFIED APPROACH: No manual SQL file execution - PostgreSQL handles initialization automatically through mounted volumes

## kill.sh file instructions:
- Purpose: The script must completely clean up everything related to the `task` project that was created using run.sh, docker-compose.yml
- Instructions:
  1. Stop and remove all containers created by docker-compose
  2. Remove all associated Docker volumes (Postgres volume, any named volumes, and anonymous volumes)
  3. Remove all Docker networks created for the task
  4. Force-remove all Docker images related to this task (postgres:15-alpine or postgres:16-alpine)
  5. Run `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` to remove any dangling containers, images, networks, and volumes that are not in use
  6. Delete the entire `/root/task/` folder where all the files were created, so that no project files remain
  7. The script should ignore errors if some resources are already removed (use `|| true` where necessary)
  8. Print logs at every step (e.g., "Stopping containers...", "Removing images...", "Deleting folder...") so the user knows what is happening
  9. After successful cleanup, print a final message like "Cleanup completed successfully! Droplet is now clean."

- Commands that should be included:
  - `docker-compose -f /root/task/docker-compose.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans || true`
  - `docker system prune -a --volumes -f`
  - `docker rmi -f postgres:15-alpine || true` (or appropriate postgres version)
  - `rm -rf /root/task`

- Dependencies cleanup:
  - Remove all PostgreSQL data directories that were mounted via volumes (e.g., `/root/task/data/pgdata`)
  - Ensure that the postgres container is cleaned up completely

- Extra instruction:
  - The script should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times without errors)
  - Always use `set -e` at the top to exit on error (except when explicitly ignored)

The output should be a valid json schema:
  - README.md (CRITICAL - Follow exact structure specified below)
  - docker-compose.yml (PostgreSQL service configuration)
  - run.sh (Script to deploy the database environment)
  - kill.sh (Complete cleanup script)
  - .gitignore (Ignore data/, *.log, .DS_Store)
  - init_database.sql (Complete database schema with intentional performance issues AND comprehensive sample data insertion)
  - sample_queries.sql (Sample queries that demonstrate the performance problems - these should run slowly before optimization)

## Code file requirements:
- All SQL files should be valid and executable PostgreSQL SQL
- **COMPLEX PROBLEMATIC SQL FILE**: `init_database.sql` should contain both the complex inefficient database schema with multiple tables, relationships, AND comprehensive sample data insertion in a single file to ensure proper execution order
- Include realistic business scenarios in table structures and data
- DO NOT include any comments that give away optimization solutions
- DO NOT include any comments that hint at the direct or indirect solution in the files
- The database should be immediately queryable but will perform poorly until candidate applies intermediate-level optimization techniques
- **FILE LOCATION**: All code and scripts must reference /root/task as the base directory

## .gitignore INSTRUCTIONS:
Generate a comprehensive .gitignore file suitable for PostgreSQL development tasks that includes:
- PostgreSQL data directories
- Log files
- Backup files (*.sql.gz, *.dump, *.backup)
- IDE and editor files
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- Any other standard exclusions for PostgreSQL development

## README.md INSTRUCTIONS:
 - The README.md contains the following sections:
   - Task Overview
   - Database Access
   - Guidance
   - Objectives
   - How to Verify
- The README.md file content MUST be fully populated with meaningful, specific content relevant to intermediate-level optimization challenges
- Task Overview section MUST contain the exact business scenario and complex performance problems that need intermediate-level optimization
- ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed
- Content must be directly relevant to the specific complex PostgreSQL optimization scenario being generated
- Use concrete business context explaining complex performance bottlenecks requiring advanced optimization techniques, not generic descriptions

### Task Overview
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This section MUST contain 2-3 meaningful sentences describing the business scenario and the specific complex performance problems affecting the database that need intermediate-level database optimization involving multiple tables, complex queries, and advanced optimization strategies.
NEVER generate empty content - always provide substantial business context that explains what complex performance issues exist and why advanced optimization is critical for business operations.

### Database Access
  - Provide the database connection details (host(droplet-ip), port, database name, username, password)
  - Mention can use any preferred database client tools (e.g., pgAdmin, DBeaver, psql, DataGrip) for advanced performance analysis and query plan examination
  - For the host, use a placeholder indicating the droplet IP (e.g., <DROPLET_IP>) rather than an actual IP address

### Guidance
  - **Advanced database context** and architectural guidance points for PostgreSQL optimization
  - **Technical architecture notes** covering PostgreSQL indexing strategies, query optimization patterns, performance tuning considerations
  - **Important considerations** for database scalability, query performance, data integrity, and maintenance overhead
  - **Database design patterns** and optimization workflow considerations
  
### Objectives
  - Clear, measurable goals for the candidate focusing on advanced database performance optimization requiring intermediate-level skills
  - This is what the candidate should be able to do successfully to demonstrate intermediate-level database optimization competency
  - These objectives will also be used to verify the task completion and award points
  - Should focus on complex performance improvement objectives with measurable outcomes (significant query execution time improvements, specific query optimization, index implementation)
  
### How to Verify
  - Specific checkpoints after optimization showing significantly improved performance metrics
  - Measure query execution time improvements
  - Validate that optimization goals are met
  - Include specific commands to test performance improvements

### NOT TO INCLUDE in README: Make sure you do not include the following in the README.md file:
