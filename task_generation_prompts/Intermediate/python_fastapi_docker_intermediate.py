PROMPT_PYTHON_DOCKER_OPTIMIZATION_INSTRUCTIONS_INTER = """
# GOAL:
As a technical architect super experienced in Docker containerization and deployment, you are given a list of real world scenarios and proficiency levels for Docker. 
Your job is to generate a task, with the given specifications, so that a candidate is presented with a Python FastAPI application that needs to be optimized and properly containerized using Docker with focus on Docker configuration, optimization, and deployment practices that require intermediate-level Docker skills.

**CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT SETUP REQUIREMENT:**
The candidate's primary responsibility is to OPTIMIZE and REFACTOR an existing Docker setup that is ALREADY DEPLOYED and FUNCTIONAL but has performance issues, inefficiencies, or suboptimal configurations. The task provides a fully working deployment with deliberate inefficiencies that the candidate must identify and fix.

# CONTEXT & CANDIDATE EXPECTATION:
The candidate will receive a FULLY DEPLOYED Python FastAPI application with a WORKING but SUBOPTIMAL Docker configuration. The application includes:
- Complete REST API endpoints with business logic already implemented and functional
- FULLY FUNCTIONAL Docker setup (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) that is DEPLOYED and RUNNING
- **CRITICAL**: The Docker setup works but has deliberate inefficiencies such as:
  - Slow container startup times (30+ seconds)
  - Large image sizes (500MB+ when could be <150MB)
  - Inefficient layer caching causing slow rebuilds
  - Missing or improper health checks causing delayed readiness
  - Resource limits not configured leading to potential memory/CPU issues
  - Running as root user (security concern)
  - Inefficient dependency installation
  - Poor network configuration
  - Missing volume optimization
  - Suboptimal base image choices
- All necessary Python dependencies and code that requires minimal to no changes
- Complete Python models, services, and routers that are already optimized
- Pre-configured application settings with correct configurations
- The application is ACCESSIBLE and RESPONDING but with performance issues
- The focus is on Docker OPTIMIZATION and REFACTORING, not Python code development

The candidate's primary responsibility is to focus on Docker optimization and refactoring (90%) with minimal Python configuration changes (10%) only as needed to enhance containerization. The task completion involves identifying inefficiencies, implementing Docker best practices, optimizing images, improving build times, enhancing security, and applying optimization techniques at an intermediate level (3-5 years experience in Docker).

## README.md INSTRUCTIONS:
 - The README.md contains the following sections:
   - Task Overview
   - Current State & Baseline Metrics
   - Helpful Tips
   - Application Access
   - Objectives
   - How to Verify 
- The README.md file content MUST be fully populated with meaningful, specific content relevant to intermediate-level Docker optimization and refactoring
- Task Overview section MUST contain the exact business scenario and Docker optimization requirements
- **CRITICAL NEW SECTION**: "Current State & Baseline Metrics" must document the DEPLOYED state and measurable inefficiencies
- ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed
- Content must be directly relevant to the specific Docker optimization scenario being generated
- Use concrete business context explaining why Docker optimization is critical for production deployment
- **CRITICAL**: Emphasize Docker optimization, refactoring, and performance improvement throughout README
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT directly tell candidates what to implement - provide direction and guidance to help them discover optimization opportunities

### Task Overview

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This section MUST contain 2-3 meaningful sentences describing the business scenario and the Docker optimization requirements. The Python application is already functional, deployed, and accessible; the focus is on optimizing the Docker setup for production efficiency, performance, and cost reduction.
NEVER generate empty content - always provide substantial business context that explains why Docker optimization is critical (e.g., reducing cloud costs, improving deployment speed, enhancing security, reducing resource consumption).

### Helpful Tips
Provide practical guidance without revealing specific implementations:
  - Suggest exploring how Docker images are built in layers and how staging can reduce final image size
  - Mention investigating what actually needs to be in the final runtime image versus build-time dependencies
  - Hint at examining different Python base image options and their size trade-offs
  - Recommend analyzing what gets copied into the image and whether all of it is necessary
  - Suggest considering how Python dependencies are installed and cached during builds
  - Point toward thinking about who the container runs as and security implications
  - Hint at exploring how Docker caches layers and what affects cache invalidation
  - Recommend measuring before and after metrics to quantify improvements
  - Suggest thinking about resource boundaries for production deployments
  - Mention considering container lifecycle signals and readiness verification
  - Use bullet points formatted as tips, starting with action words like "Consider", "Investigate", "Explore", "Analyze"
  - **CRITICAL**: Tips should guide discovery of inefficiencies, not provide direct solutions

### Application Access
  - Provide the application access details with deployed status: "The application is currently running at http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000"
  - List available API endpoints (e.g., GET /health, GET /docs, GET /api/v1/...)
  - Mention FastAPI automatic documentation: "Interactive API docs available at http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000/docs"

### Objectives
Define clear optimization goals that guide candidates toward solutions without explicitly stating implementations:
  - Frame objectives around measurable improvements rather than specific technical implementations
  - Focus on what the optimized system should achieve, not how to achieve it
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Reduce Docker image from the current baseline to minimize storage costs and improve deployment speed"
    * "Improve build times for cached builds to accelerate development and CI/CD pipelines"
    * "Reduce container startup time to enable faster scaling and deployments"
    * "Minimize resource consumption while maintaining application performance and reduce the memory and CPU usage"
    * "Implement security hardening to reduce attack surface and follow production best practices"
    * "Optimize layer caching to ensure that code changes don't require full dependency reinstallation"
    * "Improve build context efficiency to speed up image builds"
    * "focus on improving the cache and layer caching to speed up the build process"
    * "Configure appropriate resource limits to prevent runaway resource consumption"
  - Objectives should be measurable with specific improvements or target numbers
  - Should guide candidates to think about: efficiency, performance, security, cost reduction, deployment speed
  - **CRITICAL**: Objectives describe measurable outcomes and targets, never the specific implementation approach
  - Avoid phrases like "implement multi-stage builds" or "use Alpine base image" - instead describe the desired improvement

### How to Verify
Provide verification approaches that help candidates validate their optimizations with measurable results:
  - Frame verification in terms of measurable metrics and observable improvements
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Compare the optimized image size against the baseline using `docker images` - target reduction of the image size"
    * "Measure build time improvements with `time docker-compose build` for both clean and cached builds"
    * "Test container startup time by timing from container start to first successful health check"
    * "Monitor resource consumption with `docker stats` and compare against baseline metrics"
    * "Verify build cache efficiency by making a small code change and measuring rebuild time"
    * "Inspect the running container to confirm security improvements are applied"
    * "Test application responsiveness and ensure optimization doesn't impact functionality"
    * "Validate that all API endpoints continue to work correctly after optimization"
  - Suggest comparing before/after metrics to quantify improvements
  - Mention Docker commands for measurement without specifying exact implementation details
  - Guide candidates to test that optimizations don't break functionality
   Use bullet points formatted as tips, starting with action words like "Consider", "Think about", "Explore", "Review"
  - **CRITICAL**: Tips should guide discovery, not provide direct solutions or specific commands

### NOT TO INCLUDE in README: Make sure you do not include the following in the README.md file:
  - MANUAL DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS (application is already deployed)
  - Step-by-step setup instructions (deployment is automated and complete)
  - Instructions to run the run.sh file (deployment is already done)
  - Specific Docker optimization solutions (e.g., "use multi-stage builds", "switch to Alpine image")
  - Direct implementation hints (e.g., "add BuildKit cache mounts", "copy requirements.txt separately")
  - Python optimization instructions (Python code is already optimized)
  - Explicit technology choices (let candidates decide the optimization approach)
  - Code snippets or configuration examples
  - Phrases like "you should implement", "make sure to add", "configure the following"
  - Deployment troubleshooting (application is working, focus is on optimization)
