# INSTRUCTIONS:

## Nature of the task 
- Task must ask to implement a feature from scratch or fix bugs in the existing code.
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are historically accurate and relevant to the context. 
- Generate enough starter code that gives the candidate a good starting point to start solving the task
- DO NOT GIVE AWAY THE SOLUTION IN THE STARTER CODE.
- A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement best practices, design the solution correctly and not just fix the errors
- The question should be a real-world scenario and not a trick question that is syntactic errors.
- The complexity of the task and specific ask expected from the candidate must align with the proficiency level required in the competency definition, ensuring that no two questions generated are similar. 
- For BEGINNER and BASIC and INTERMEDIATE levels of proficiency, the questions must be more specific and less open ended. The scenarios must also be easily digestible for these levels.
- For ADVANCED and EXPERT levels of proficiency, the questions must be more open ended, require application of fundamental concepts and complex according to proficiency. The scenarios must also be complex and challenging for these levels.
- The question must NOT include hints. The hints will be provided in the "hints" field. 
- Ensure that all questions and scenarios adhere to the latest best practices and language versions. Strictly avoid using outdated versions of the language in the code scenarios.
- If you include diagrams, ensure they are written in mermaid format, properly indented and also in code blocks.

## AI AND EXTERNAL RESOURCE POLICY:
- Candidates are permitted and encouraged to use any external resources they find helpful, including but not limited to Google, Stack Overflow, official documentation, and AI-powered tools, agentic IDs, or Large Language Models (LLMs). 
- The tasks are designed to assess the candidate's ability to effectively find, understand, integrate, and adapt solutions to solve a specific problem, rather than testing rote memorization. Therefore, the complexity of the tasks for every proficiency level should reflect this, requiring genuine engineering and problem-solving skills that go beyond simple copy-pasting from a generative AI.

## Code Generation Instructions:
Based on the real-world scenarios provided above, create a FastAPI task that:
- Draws inspiration from the input_scenarios given below to determine the business context and technical requirements
- Matches the complexity level appropriate for proficiency level and years of experience given as input, keeping in mind that AI assistance is allowed.
- Tests practical FastAPI skills that require more than a simple AI query to solve, even while keeping the competency scope and proficiency level in mind.
- Time constraints: Each task should be finished within {minutes_range} minutes.
- At every time pick different real-world scenario from the list provided above to ensure variety in task generation.

## Starter Code Instructions:
- The starter code should only provide starting directions so that the candidate is not clueless to begin with.
- The code files generated must be valid and executable.
- Keep the code files minimal and to the point.
- A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement best practices, design the solution correctly and not just fix the errors, so make sure the starter code leaves room for the candidate to implement the solution the way they want.
- If the task is to fix bugs, make sure the starter code has a logical bug (no syntactic errors) that is substantial enough to test the proficiency levels given as input.
- If the task is to implement a feature from scratch, make sure the starter code only provides a good starting point.
- Python FastAPI starter code do NOT require any infrastructure setup (dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, etc.)

# OUTPUT

The output should be a valid json schema:
  - README.md (CRITICAL - Follow exact structure specified below)
  - requirements.txt (Python dependencies including fastapi and other dependencies that are required in the scenario)
  - .gitignore (Ignore .pyc files, **pycache**, venv/, .env, \*.log)
  - Any code files that are to be included as a part of the task. These should not include the solution but should be a good starting point for the candidate to start solving the task.

# REQUIRED OUTPUT JSON STRUCTURE:

{{
   "name": "Task Name",
   "question": "A short description of the task scenario including the specific ask from the candidate — what needs to be fixed/implemented?",
   "code_files": {{
      "README.md": "Candidate-facing README with Task Overview, Guidance, Objectives, and How to Verify",
      ".gitignore": "Proper Python and Docker exclusions",
      "requirements.txt": "Python dependencies list",
      "starter_code_file_name": "starter_code_file_content"
      "starter_code_file_name_2": "starter_code_file_content_2"
      ...
  }},
  "outcomes": "Expected results after completion in 2-3 lines. Use simple english.",
  "pre_requisites": "Bullet-point list of tools, libraries, and environment setup required to complete the task.Mention things like Python 3.10+, Git, Docker, pip, PostgreSQL installation, virtual environment support, etc.",
  "answer": "High-level solution approach",
  "hints": " a single line hint on what a good approach to solve the task could include. These hints must NOT give away the answer, but gently nudge the candidate in the right direction.",
  "definitions": {{
    "terminology_1": "definition_1",
    "terminology_2": "definition_2",
    ...
    }}
}}
 
## Code file requirements:
- More than 1 files can be generated but but make sure they are included in the JSON structure correctly.
- Code should follow python PEP8 guidelines
- **CRITICAL**: The generated code files MUST NOT contain the implementation for the core logic of the task. They should only provide the necessary boilerplate, file structure, and minimal setup code.
- The core business logic functions or class methods that the candidate needs to implement MUST be left empty.
- DO NOT include any 'TODO' or placeholder comments
- DO NOT include any comments that give away hints or solutions e.g. 
"
async def send_confirmation_email(email: str):
    # Simulate sending an email (mocked for now)
    # Should print to console/log to simulate side effect
    pass

@app.post("/register")
async def register_user(request: UserRegistrationRequest, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    # Registration logic here (could be just echo/pass)
    # Intended: background_tasks.add_task(send_confirmation_email, request.email)
    # Should return a success message
    pass
 " this is BAD. DO NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS LIKE "Intended" or "insert logic here" etc

- The generated project structure should be runnable, but the code requiring implementation will not function correctly until the candidate completes the task.

## .gitignore INSTRUCTIONS:Standard python gitignore
- Ignore .pyc files, **pycache**, venv/, .env, \*.log
- add all the reuired exclusions for python projects

## README.md INSTRUCTIONS:
 - The README.md contains the following sections:
   - Task Overview
   - Guidance
   - Objectives
   - How to Verify 
- The README.md file content MUST be fully populated with meaningful, specific content
- Task Overview section MUST contain the exact business scenario from the task description
- ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed
- Content must be directly relevant to the specific task scenario being generated
- Use concrete business context, not generic descriptions

### Task Overview

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This section MUST contain 2-3 meaningful sentences describing the business scenario, current situation. 
NEVER generate empty content - always provide substantial business context that explains what the candidate is working on and why it matters.

### Guidance
  - Guidance explains given files only in 2-3 lines. In Bullet Points only.
  - Guidance should point out any specific files that are important to the task in 1-2 lines.

### Objectives
  - Clear, measurable goals for the candidate
  - This is what the candidate should be able to do successfully to say that they have completed the task.
  - These objectives will also be used to verify the task completion and award points.
  - What functionality should be implemented, expected behavior or outcomes

### How to Verify
  - Specific checkpoints after implementation, what to test and how to confirm success
  - Observable behaviors or outputs to validate
  - These points will help the candidate to verify their own work and the video recording of them performing these steps will also help the assessor to see how thorough they are in checking their own work and award points.

### NOT TO INCLUDE in README: Make sure you do not include the following in the README.md file:
  - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS OR COMMANDS
  - Direct solutions or hints
  - Step-by-step implementation guides
