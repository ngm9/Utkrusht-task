# React + TypeScript Optimization Task Requirements (INTERMEDIATE Level)

## GOAL
As a technical architect super experienced in React and TypeScript, you are given real-world scenarios and proficiency levels for React development. Your job is to generate an entire task definition, including TypeScript code files, README.md, expected outcomes, etc., that can be effectively used to assess the candidate's ability to effectively think, design, build, implement, debug, or in general solve a problem end to end.

## INSTRUCTIONS

### Nature of the Task
- Task must ask to optimize existing TypeScript React code
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are historically accurate and relevant to the context
- **Time Constraint**: Each task MUST be completable within 30-45 minutes by a candidate with INTERMEDIATE proficiency (3-5 years React experience)
- **Complexity Level**: Tasks should require deeper understanding of React internals, advanced TypeScript patterns, and architectural decision-making

### CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR FULLY FUNCTIONAL STARTER CODE

**TYPESCRIPT IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **ALL code files MUST use TypeScript** (.tsx for components, .ts for utilities)
- **MUST include a valid tsconfig.json** with proper React and TypeScript configurations including strict mode enabled
- **MUST include proper type definitions** for props, state, API responses, function parameters, custom hooks, context providers, and higher-order components
- **INTERMEDIATE TypeScript features MUST be implemented**: generics, union types, intersection types, type guards, utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record), conditional types where applicable
- **NO TypeScript errors** - The application must compile without any type errors
- **NO 'any' types** - All types must be properly defined with appropriate specificity (components, functions, API responses, event handlers, custom hooks, higher-order components, context values)
- **Package.json MUST include TypeScript dependencies**: typescript, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/node, and any additional @types packages for third-party libraries used
- **Advanced type patterns**: Proper typing for custom hooks with generics, discriminated unions for complex state, mapped types where appropriate
- **IMPORTANT FOR TASK DESIGN**: While the starter code must be fully runnable and type-safe overall, you SHOULD intentionally leave a few non-critical type definitions (for example, some derived state types, secondary utility function generics, or less central context value refinements) for the candidate to improve or complete as part of the exercise, and clearly call this out in the candidate-facing README description (without revealing exact solutions).

**FUNCTIONAL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- **The starter code MUST be a complete, working React + TypeScript application** that runs successfully immediately after `npm install` and `npm start`
- **ZERO compilation errors, ZERO TypeScript errors, ZERO runtime errors, ZERO warnings**
- **All UI must render correctly** - Every component, page, and UI element must display properly
- **All existing functionality must work** - API calls execute, data loads and displays, user interactions work, forms submit, state management functions correctly
- **The candidate should NOT need to fix anything to make the app run** - The app is already fully functional
- **Application must include multiple interconnected features** - Multiple pages/views, complex state management, data dependencies between components

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UNOPTIMIZED CODE:**
- **DO NOT include ANY performance optimizations** - NO React.memo, NO useMemo, NO useCallback, NO request caching, NO request batching, NO debouncing, NO throttling, NO virtualization, NO lazy loading, NO code splitting, NO dynamic imports
- **DO NOT include efficient state management patterns** - NO normalized state, NO selector optimization, NO state colocation, NO context splitting
- **The code must be intentionally inefficient but functionally correct** - Perfect functionality but poor performance under load with multiple performance bottlenecks
- **The candidate's task is ONLY to optimize the working application** - Identify bottlenecks and implement optimizations, NOT fix broken functionality
- **Include architectural inefficiencies** - Prop drilling, context value recreation, unnecessary component coupling, inefficient data structures

### Task Complexity Requirements

**SCOPE FOR 30-45 MINUTE COMPLETION:**
- Task must be achievable within 30-45 minutes by an INTERMEDIATE level candidate
- Focus on 4-6 specific optimization areas that require analytical thinking
- Provide a working application with multiple interrelated performance issues
- Optimization should require architectural understanding and strategic decision-making
- Examples of appropriate 30-45 minute optimizations:
  - Optimize complex component trees (8-15 components) with multiple re-render cascades
  - Implement strategic memoization across custom hooks and utility functions
  - Refactor inefficient state management patterns (context optimization, state normalization)
  - Build request caching layer with cache invalidation strategy
  - Implement request deduplication and batching for multiple concurrent API calls
  - Add virtualization for multiple large lists with different data types
  - Optimize expensive computations across multiple components
  - Implement code splitting strategy for route-based or component-based lazy loading
  - Refactor context providers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Optimize data transformation and filtering pipelines

**APPROPRIATE FOR INTERMEDIATE TASKS:**
- Analyzing and optimizing component hierarchies requiring architectural changes
- Implementing custom hooks for optimization logic (e.g., useDebounce, useThrottle, useMemoizedCallback)
- Building caching mechanisms with TypeScript-safe implementations
- Optimizing complex data flows and state dependencies
- Implementing performance monitoring and measurement strategies

- **NO efficient state patterns**: NO normalized state, NO memoized selectors, NO context splitting, NO state colocation
- **NO advanced optimization patterns**: Keep TypeScript patterns functional but not optimized for performance
- **NO fully optimized code**: The code must be intentionally inefficient but functionally correct

### AI and External Resource Policy
- Candidates are permitted to use external resources including AI tools, documentation, Stack Overflow
- Tasks assess ability to find, understand, integrate, and adapt solutions with deeper analysis
- Complexity should require genuine problem-solving, architectural thinking, and strategic optimization beyond simple copy-pasting
- Candidates should demonstrate ability to evaluate trade-offs between different optimization approaches

### Code Generation Instructions
Based on real-world scenarios, create a React + TypeScript task that:
- Draws inspiration from input scenarios for business context
- Matches INTERMEDIATE proficiency level (3-5 years React + TypeScript experience)
- Can be completed within 30-45 minutes
- Tests practical React + TypeScript optimization skills with architectural considerations
- Focuses on multiple interconnected optimization opportunities requiring strategic thinking
- Includes measurable performance issues across different application layers
- Task name: short, descriptive, under 50 characters, kebab-case (e.g., "react-ts-analytics-platform-optimization")
- **CRITICAL - FILE NAMING**: All additional component, page, hook, context, and utility files MUST use meaningful, scenario-specific file names derived from the task (e.g., OrdersDashboard.tsx, AnalyticsChart.tsx, useOrders.ts, CartContext.tsx). NEVER use generic placeholder names like PageA, ComponentA, useCustomHook, SomeContext, or helpers.ts when a scenario-specific name is appropriate. File names should reflect the business domain and feature so generated code is identifiable and varies correctly per task.

## README.md STRUCTURE (React + TypeScript Optimization - INTERMEDIATE)

- The README.md contains the following sections:
   - Task Overview
   - Objectives
   - How to Verify
   - Helpful Tips
- The README.md file content MUST be fully populated with meaningful, specific content
- Task Overview section MUST contain the exact business scenario from the task description
- ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed
- Content must be directly relevant to the specific task scenario being generated
- Use concrete business context, not generic descriptions
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT directly tell candidates what to implement - provide direction and guidance to help them discover solutions

### Task Overview (MANDATORY - 3-4 substantial sentences)
**CRITICAL**: Describe the specific business scenario where a React + TypeScript application is experiencing significant performance issues across multiple areas. Explain that the application is fully functional and type-safe, but suffers from complex performance problems under realistic load (e.g., cascading re-renders across features, redundant API calls from multiple sources, slow UI updates affecting user experience, inefficient state management). Connect the business problem (real-time analytics platform, complex SaaS dashboard, data-intensive application, multi-feature enterprise tool) to the need for comprehensive optimization requiring architectural thinking. Make clear this is a 30-45 minute optimization task focusing on multiple interconnected improvements requiring analysis and strategic decision-making.

### Objectives
Define goals focusing on outcomes for a 30-45 minute optimization task requiring architectural understanding:

- Analyze and identify performance bottlenecks across multiple application areas using profiling tools
- Reduce unnecessary component re-renders throughout complex component hierarchies
- Optimize state management patterns to prevent cascading updates
- Refactor API call patterns to eliminate redundancy and implement efficient caching strategies
- Implement strategic memoization across components, hooks, and utility functions
- Optimize context providers to minimize unnecessary consumer re-renders
- Improve UI responsiveness under realistic load conditions across all features
- Maintain TypeScript type safety while implementing architectural optimizations
- Apply advanced React performance best practices to critical rendering paths
- Make informed trade-off decisions between different optimization approaches
- Measure and verify performance improvements with quantitative metrics
- Ensure optimizations maintain code readability and maintainability

**CRITICAL**: Scope should be achievable in 30-45 minutes with multiple interconnected optimization opportunities

### How to Verify
Verification approaches for intermediate-level optimizations with quantitative measurement:

- Use React DevTools Profiler to measure render frequency, render duration, and component hierarchy performance before and after optimizations
- Monitor network tab to verify reduced API call count and identify request patterns
- Measure initial load time and time-to-interactive metrics
- Interact with all UI features and observe responsiveness improvements across the application
- Confirm TypeScript compilation remains error-free with no type safety regressions
- Verify all existing functionality still works correctly across all features
- Check console for any new warnings or errors introduced by optimizations
- Measure specific quantitative metrics (render count per interaction, API call count, computation time, memory usage) before/after
- Test edge cases and high-load scenarios to verify optimization effectiveness
- Profile expensive operations to confirm optimization impact
- Verify that optimizations maintain code readability and don't introduce complexity debt

**CRITICAL**: Focus on measurable, verifiable improvements with comprehensive testing

### Helpful Tips
Practical guidance without revealing implementations, geared toward intermediate-level analytical thinking:

- Consider how React's rendering cycle and reconciliation algorithm impact performance across component trees
- Think about when components unnecessarily re-render and how this cascades through the application
- Review how API calls are triggered from different parts of the application and identify duplication patterns
- Analyze data flow patterns and identify where state changes trigger unnecessary updates
- Consider TypeScript's role in maintaining type safety during architectural refactoring
- Explore React's built-in optimization hooks and when each is most appropriate
- Think about component composition patterns and responsibility separation across features
- Review browser DevTools (React Profiler, Performance tab, Network tab) for comprehensive performance analysis
- Consider context provider optimization and when to split contexts
- Explore custom hook patterns for encapsulating optimization logic
- Think about data normalization and efficient data structures
- Review expensive computations and identify memoization opportunities
- Consider code splitting strategies for reducing initial load
- Analyze the trade-offs between different optimization approaches
- Think about measuring performance improvements quantitatively
- Use bullet points starting with "Consider", "Think about", "Explore", "Review", "Analyze"

**CRITICAL**: Guide discovery and analytical thinking, never provide direct solutions

### NOT TO INCLUDE:
- Step-by-step implementation instructions
- Exact code solutions
- Configuration examples with specific code
- Specific library recommendations beyond React built-ins and standard tools
- Phrases like "you should implement", "add the following code"
- Direct answers to architectural decisions
