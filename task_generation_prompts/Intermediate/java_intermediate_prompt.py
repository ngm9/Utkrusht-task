# GOAL:
As a technical architect super experienced in Java and modern Java ecosystem, you are given a list of real world scenarios and proficiency levels for Java development. 
Your job is to generate an entire task definition, including code files, README.md, expected outcomes etc. that can be effectively used to assess the candidate's ability to effectively think, design, build, implement, debug or in general solve a problem end to end at an intermediate level.

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## Nature of the task 
- Task must ask to implement a feature from scratch, refactor existing code, or fix complex bugs in the existing codebase.
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are historically accurate and relevant to the context. 
- Generate enough starter code that gives the candidate a good starting point to start solving the task
- DO NOT GIVE AWAY THE SOLUTION IN THE STARTER CODE.
- A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement best practices, design the solution correctly, demonstrate proper architecture decisions, and not just fix the errors
- The question should be a real-world scenario that tests architectural thinking and not just implementation skills.
- The complexity of the task and specific ask expected from the candidate must align with INTERMEDIATE proficiency level (3-5 years Java experience), ensuring that no two questions generated are similar. 
- For INTERMEDIATE level of proficiency, the questions should test deeper understanding and require candidates to demonstrate:
  - **Advanced OOP Design**: Design patterns (Factory, Strategy, Observer, Builder, etc.), SOLID principles, abstraction
  - **Architecture & Structure**: Layered architecture, separation of concerns, dependency injection, modularity
  - **Performance Optimization**: Efficient algorithms, memory management, concurrency patterns, lazy initialization
  - **Advanced Java Features**: Streams API, Optional, functional interfaces, lambdas, generics with wildcards
  - **Project Architecture**: Package structure design, separation of concerns, modular design
  - **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions, exception hierarchy, graceful degradation, logging strategies
  - **Testing Considerations**: Unit testing with JUnit/TestNG, mockable design, test-driven development patterns
  - **Code Quality**: Modern Java features (Java 8+), clean code principles, documentation practices
  - **Real-world Patterns**: Data access patterns, caching strategies, thread-safe implementations
  - **Concurrency**: Thread management, synchronization, concurrent collections, ExecutorService
- The question must NOT include hints. The hints will be provided in the "hints" field. 
- Ensure that all questions and scenarios adhere to modern Java best practices (Java 8+) and current development standards. Use modern Java features appropriately.
- Tasks should require candidates to make architectural decisions and justify their approach.
- If you include diagrams, ensure they are written in mermaid format, properly indented and also in code blocks.

## AI AND EXTERNAL RESOURCE POLICY:
- Candidates are permitted and encouraged to use any external resources they find helpful, including but not limited to Google, Stack Overflow, official documentation, and AI-powered tools, agentic IDs, or Large Language Models (LLMs). 
- The tasks are designed to assess the candidate's ability to effectively find, understand, integrate, and adapt solutions to solve a specific problem, rather than testing rote memorization. Therefore, the complexity of the tasks should reflect intermediate Java proficiency while requiring genuine engineering and architectural skills that go beyond simple copy-pasting from a generative AI.
- Tasks should test the candidate's ability to evaluate different approaches and choose the most appropriate solution.

## Code Generation Instructions:
Based on the real-world scenarios provided in following conversations, create a Java task that:
- Draws inspiration from the input_scenarios given to determine the business context and technical requirements
- Matches the complexity level appropriate for INTERMEDIATE proficiency level (3-5 years Java experience), keeping in mind that AI assistance is allowed.
- Tests practical Java skills that require architectural thinking, performance considerations, and advanced pattern implementation
- Time constraints: Each task should be finished within {minutes_range} minutes.
- At every time pick different real-world scenario from the list provided above to ensure variety in task generation.
- Focus on multi-class applications that require thoughtful architecture and design patterns
- Should test the candidate's ability to structure a scalable Java application

## Starter Code Instructions:
- The starter code should provide a foundation that allows candidates to demonstrate architectural skills
- The code files generated must be valid and executable with `mvn compile` or `gradle build`.
- Provide a realistic project structure that mimics real-world applications
- A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement best practices, design the solution correctly, demonstrate proper package structure, and architectural decisions
- If the task is to fix bugs, make sure the starter code has logical bugs or architectural issues (no syntactic errors) that require intermediate-level thinking to resolve
- If the task is to implement a feature from scratch, provide a foundation that allows candidates to showcase proper class design and architecture
- Java starter code should include realistic project structure but NOT require complex infrastructure setup
- Include some existing classes/interfaces/utilities that the candidate needs to work with or extend
- Provide partial implementations that require candidates to complete the architecture

# OUTPUT
The output should be a valid json schema:
  - README.md (CRITICAL - Follow exact structure specified below)
  - pom.xml (Maven dependencies) OR build.gradle (Gradle dependencies)
  - .gitignore (Standard Java project gitignore)
  - Any code files that are to be included as a part of the task. These should not include the solution but should be a good starting point for the candidate to start solving the task.
  - Code files should demonstrate partial architecture that candidate needs to complete/extend
  - Include realistic folder structure (src/main/java/com/company/package/, src/main/resources/, src/test/java/, etc.)

## .gitignore INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a comprehensive gitignore file that covers all standard exclusions for intermediate Java projects including target directories, build directories, IDE configurations (.idea/, .vscode/, .eclipse/, *.iml), compiled class files (*.class), JAR files, log files, and other common development artifacts that should not be tracked in version control.

## README.md INSTRUCTIONS:
 - The README.md contains the following sections:
   - Task Overview
   - Helpful Tips
   - Objectives
   - How to Verify 
- The README.md file content MUST be fully populated with meaningful, specific content
- Task Overview section MUST contain the exact business scenario from the task description
- ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed
- Content must be directly relevant to the specific task scenario being generated
- Use concrete business context, not generic descriptions
- **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT directly tell candidates what to implement - provide direction and guidance to help them discover solutions

### Task Overview

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: This section MUST contain 3-4 meaningful sentences describing the business scenario, current situation, and why architectural considerations matter for this use case. 
NEVER generate empty content - always provide substantial business context that explains what the candidate is working on and why proper architecture is crucial.

### Helpful Tips
Provide practical guidance without revealing specific implementations:
  - Suggest exploring architectural patterns that promote separation of concerns and maintainability
  - Mention thinking about how different components should interact and communicate
  - Hint at considering object-oriented principles that make code flexible and extensible
  - Recommend exploring how to handle errors gracefully throughout the application layers
  - Suggest thinking about performance implications of different data structure and algorithm choices
  - Point toward considering how the code can be made testable and mockable
  - Hint at exploring modern Java features that can make code more concise and readable
  - Recommend considering thread safety and concurrency implications if multiple operations happen simultaneously
  - Suggest analyzing whether common patterns exist that could be abstracted into reusable components
  - Mention thinking about how to organize code into logical packages that reflect business domains
  - Use bullet points formatted as tips, starting with action words like "Consider", "Think about", "Explore", "Review", "Analyze"
  - **CRITICAL**: Tips should guide discovery toward architectural thinking, not provide direct solutions or specific design patterns
  - Frame suggestions around principles and outcomes rather than specific implementations
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Consider how to isolate business logic from external dependencies for better testability"
    * "Think about organizing related functionality into cohesive units"
    * "Explore approaches that allow behavior to vary without modifying existing code"
    * "Review how to handle different types of failures appropriately at each layer"
    * "Consider memory and processing efficiency when working with large data sets"

### Objectives
  - Clear, measurable goals for the candidate appropriate for intermediate level
  - This is what the candidate should be able to do successfully to say that they have completed the task
  - These objectives will also be used to verify the task completion and award points
  - What functionality should be implemented, expected behavior, and architectural qualities
  - Focus on both functional requirements and code quality metrics
  - Include expectations for package structure, class design, and performance
  - Frame objectives around outcomes rather than specific technical implementations
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Implement functionality that processes orders efficiently while maintaining data consistency"
    * "Design a solution that allows new payment methods to be added without modifying existing code"
    * "Create a system that gracefully handles various failure scenarios with appropriate recovery"
    * "Organize code into layers that separate concerns and promote maintainability"
    * "Ensure thread-safe operations when multiple users access shared resources concurrently"
  - Objectives should be measurable but not prescribe specific patterns or approaches
  - Should guide candidates to think about: scalability, maintainability, performance, testability, extensibility
  - **CRITICAL**: Objectives describe the "what" and "why", never the "how"

### How to Verify
  - Specific checkpoints after implementation, what to test and how to confirm success
  - Observable behaviors or outputs to validate both functionality and architecture
  - Code quality checkpoints (class structure, performance, error handling)
  - These points will help the candidate to verify their own work and the video recording of them performing these steps will also help the assessor to see how thorough they are in checking their own work and award points
  - Include both functional testing and architectural assessment criteria
  - Performance and edge case validation points
  - Frame verification in terms of observable outcomes and system behaviors
  - Examples of proper framing:
    * "Test the system with various input scenarios including edge cases and invalid data"
    * "Verify that the application handles concurrent requests without data corruption"
    * "Confirm error messages are meaningful and guide users toward resolution"
    * "Check that the solution performs acceptably with realistic data volumes"
    * "Validate that changes to one component don't require modifications to unrelated components"
    * "Ensure the code can be unit tested in isolation without requiring external dependencies"
  - Suggest what to verify and why it matters, not specific implementation details to check
  - Guide candidates to test: functionality, edge cases, performance, concurrency, error scenarios
  - **CRITICAL**: Describe what to verify and expected behaviors, not the specific implementation to check

### NOT TO INCLUDE in README: Make sure you do not include the following in the README.md file:
  - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS OR COMMANDS (mvn clean install, mvn compile, mvn test, java -jar, etc.)
  - Direct solutions or architectural decisions
  - Step-by-step implementation guides
  - Specific design patterns or implementation approaches (e.g., "use Factory pattern", "implement Strategy pattern")
  - Direct answers and code snippets that would give away the solution to the task
  - Any specific class implementation details that would give away the solution to the task
  - Should not provide any particular architectural approach or design pattern to implement the solution
  - Class names or specific implementation strategies that would reveal the solution
  - Package structure decisions that would dictate the architectural approach
  - Phrases like "you should implement", "make sure to add", "create a class called X"
  - Specific Java API recommendations that would reveal the solution approach
