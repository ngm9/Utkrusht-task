# GOAL:
As a technical architect experienced in Docker containerization and deployment, you are given real-world scenarios and proficiency levels for Docker. Your job is to generate a task where a candidate optimizes and properly containerizes a Golang REST API application using Docker, focusing on configuration, optimization, and deployment practices requiring intermediate-level Docker skills.

# CONTEXT & CANDIDATE EXPECTATION:
The candidate receives a FULLY DEPLOYED Golang REST API application with a WORKING but SUBOPTIMAL Docker configuration. The application includes:
- Complete REST API endpoints with business logic already implemented and functional
- Functional Docker setup (Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml) that is deployed and running
- All necessary Go dependencies and code requiring minimal to no changes
- Complete Go handlers, services, and middleware that are already optimized
- Pre-configured application settings
- The application is accessible and responding but with performance issues

The candidate's primary responsibility is Docker optimization and refactoring (90%) with minimal Go configuration changes (10%) only as needed to enhance containerization.

# DEPLOYMENT BASELINE REQUIREMENT:
When generating task files, the Docker setup MUST be:
- Fully deployable and functional on first run
- Deliberately inefficient but not broken
- Measurably suboptimal with clear improvement opportunities
- Providing baseline metrics for candidates to improve upon
- Initial deployment should NOT fail - provide minimal working setup

The inefficiencies should be measurable:
- Slow container startup times (20+ seconds)
- Large image sizes (800MB+ when could be <20MB)
- Inefficient layer caching causing slow rebuilds
- Missing or improper health checks
- Resource limits not configured
- Running as root user
- Inefficient build process
- Poor network configuration
- Suboptimal base image choices
- Not utilizing Go build optimization flags

### Dockerfile Instructions:
MUST be functional and deployed but deliberately inefficient, requiring optimization:
- Single-stage build using golang:latest (convert to multi-stage with scratch/alpine/distroless)
- Using bloated base image instead of optimized alternatives
- Not leveraging Go module caching properly
- Inefficient layer ordering causing poor cache utilization
- Basic .dockerignore or missing
- Running as root user

  2. Remove all associated Docker volumes
  3. Remove all Docker networks created for the task
  4. Force-remove all Docker images related to this task
  5. Run `docker system prune -a --volumes -f` to remove dangling resources
  6. Delete the entire `/root/task/` folder
  7. Ignore errors if some resources are already removed (use `|| true`)
  8. Print logs at every step
  9. Print final message "Cleanup completed successfully! Droplet is now clean."

- Commands to include:
  - `docker-compose -f /root/task/docker-compose.yml down --volumes --remove-orphans || true`

- Log files (*.log, logs/)
- Docker volumes and data directories
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)
- Standard exclusions for Go/Docker development

## .dockerignore INSTRUCTIONS:
Should be basic or missing - candidate needs to optimize this as part of Docker optimization to reduce build context size and improve build performance

## README.md INSTRUCTIONS:
The README.md contains ONLY the following sections:
- Task Overview
- Objectives
- How to Verify
- Helpful Tips

ALL sections must have substantial content - no empty or placeholder text allowed. Content must be directly relevant to the specific Docker optimization scenario.

### Task Overview
This section MUST contain 2-3 meaningful sentences describing the business scenario and the Docker optimization requirements. The Golang application is already functional, deployed, and accessible; the focus is on optimizing the Docker setup for production efficiency, performance, and cost reduction specific to Go applications.

Provide substantial business context explaining why Docker optimization is critical (e.g., reducing cloud costs through smaller images, improving deployment speed with faster builds, enhancing security with minimal attack surface, reducing resource consumption, leveraging Go's compilation advantages).

### Objectives
Define clear optimization goals that guide candidates toward solutions without explicitly stating implementations:
- Frame objectives around measurable improvements rather than specific technical implementations
- Focus on what the optimized system should achieve, not how to achieve it
- Examples of proper framing for Golang:
  * "Reduce Docker image from current baseline to below 50MB"
  * "Achieve sub-30-second build times for cached builds"
  * "Reduce container startup time to under 5 seconds"
  * "Minimize resource consumption while maintaining performance"
  * "Reduce compiled binary size by at least 60%"
  * "Implement security hardening to minimize attack surface"
  * "Optimize layer caching to ensure module changes don't require full rebuild"
  * "Improve build context efficiency to speed up builds by 70%+"
  * "Configure appropriate resource limits"
  * "Leverage Go's static compilation for maximum portability"
  * "Ensure zero-downtime deployments with proper health checks"
- Objectives should be measurable with specific improvements or target numbers
- Should guide candidates to think about: efficiency, performance, security, cost reduction, deployment speed, Go-specific optimizations
- Objectives describe measurable outcomes and targets, never the specific implementation approach

### Helpful Tips
Provide practical guidance without revealing specific implementations:
- Suggest exploring Go's static compilation capabilities and minimal runtime images
- Mention investigating difference between build-time and runtime dependencies
- Hint at examining different Go base image options and trade-offs
- Recommend analyzing Go module caching strategies during Docker builds
- Suggest considering how Go compilation flags can reduce binary size
- Point toward thinking about CGO dependencies and static vs dynamic linking
- Hint at exploring how Docker layer caching interacts with Go's build process
- Recommend measuring before and after metrics to quantify improvements
- Suggest thinking about security implications of including build tools in runtime images
- Mention considering container lifecycle signals and graceful shutdown
- Point toward analyzing what files are actually needed in build context
- Suggest exploring how Go's fast compilation can be leveraged
- Use bullet points formatted as tips, starting with action words like "Consider", "Investigate", "Explore", "Analyze","Think about"
- Tips should guide discovery of inefficiencies, not provide direct solutions

### How to Verify
Provide verification approaches that help candidates validate their optimizations with measurable results:
- Frame verification in terms of measurable metrics and observable improvements
- Examples for Golang:
  * "Compare the optimized image size against baseline using `docker images` - target below 50MB"
  * "Measure build time improvements with `time docker-compose build` for clean and cached builds"
  * "Test container startup time by timing from container start to first successful health check"
  * "Monitor resource consumption with `docker stats` and compare against baseline"
  * "Verify build cache efficiency by making small code change and measuring rebuild time"
  * "Inspect running container to confirm minimal base image and non-root user"
  * "Measure compiled binary size using `docker run --rm <image> ls -lh /app/binary`"
  * "Test application responsiveness and ensure optimization doesn't impact functionality"
  * "Validate that all API endpoints continue to work correctly"
  * "Verify static compilation by checking binary dependencies"
  * "Confirm Go module caching by rebuilding after dependency changes"
- Suggest comparing before/after metrics to quantify improvements
- Mention Docker commands for measurement without specifying exact implementation details
- Guide candidates to test that optimizations don't break functionality

### NOT TO INCLUDE in README:
- Manual deployment instructions (application is already deployed)
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- Instructions to run the run.sh file
- Specific Docker optimization solutions
- Direct implementation hints
- Go optimization instructions
- Explicit technology choices
- Code snippets or configuration examples
- Phrases like "you should implement", "make sure to add", "configure the following"
- Deployment troubleshooting
- Any comments or annotations
