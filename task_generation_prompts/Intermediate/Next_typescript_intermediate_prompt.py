# GOAL:
As a technical architect super experienced in Next.js and TypeScript, you are given a list of real world scenarios and proficiency levels for Next.js + TypeScript. 
Your job is to generate an entire task definition, including code files, README.md, expected outcomes etc. that can be effectively used to assess the candidate's ability to effectively think, design, build, implement, debug or in general solve a problem end to end at an **INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (3-5 years of experience)**.

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## Nature of the task 
- Task must ask to implement a feature from scratch or fix bugs in the existing code, with **moderate complexity requiring architectural decisions**.
- The question scenario must be clear, ensuring that all facts, figures, company names, individual names, etc., are historically accurate and relevant to the context. 
- Generate enough starter code that gives the candidate a good starting point to start solving the task
- DO NOT GIVE AWAY THE SOLUTION IN THE STARTER CODE.
- A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement best practices, design the solution correctly and not just fix the errors
- The question should be a real-world scenario and not a trick question that is syntactic errors.
- **For INTERMEDIATE level proficiency (3-5 years experience)**: Tasks should involve multiple interconnected components, require understanding of Next.js architecture patterns (App Router, Server Components, Client Components), state management considerations, API design, TypeScript generics and advanced types, performance optimization basics, and proper error handling strategies.
- **Complexity expectations**: The task should require candidates to make architectural decisions, implement custom hooks, handle complex data flows, work with multiple API endpoints, implement proper loading and error states, use TypeScript effectively for type safety, and demonstrate understanding of Next.js rendering strategies.
- The question must NOT include hints. The hints will be provided in the "hints" field. 
- Ensure that all questions and scenarios adhere to the latest Next.js best practices and TypeScript versions. Strictly avoid using outdated versions of Next.js (below 13) or TypeScript in the code scenarios.
- **Advanced patterns expected**: Server Actions, Suspense boundaries, proper data fetching patterns, middleware usage, dynamic imports, and optimization techniques.
- If you include diagrams, ensure they are written in mermaid format, properly indented and also in code blocks.

## AI AND EXTERNAL RESOURCE POLICY:
- Candidates are permitted and encouraged to use any external resources they find helpful, including but not limited to Google, Stack Overflow, official documentation, and AI-powered tools, agentic IDs, or Large Language Models (LLMs). 
- **For intermediate level**: The tasks are designed to assess the candidate's ability to effectively find, understand, integrate, and adapt solutions to solve a specific problem that requires architectural thinking and multiple technology integrations, rather than testing rote memorization. The complexity should require genuine engineering and problem-solving skills that go well beyond simple copy-pasting from a generative AI.

## Code Generation Instructions:
Based on the real-world scenarios provided in following conversations, create a Next.js + TypeScript task that:
- Draws inspiration from the input_scenarios given to determine the business context and technical requirements
- **Matches intermediate complexity (3-5 years experience)**: Should involve multiple components working together, API integrations, state management, performance considerations, and advanced TypeScript usage.
- Tests practical Next.js + TypeScript skills that require more than a simple AI query to solve, including architectural decisions and best practices implementation.
- **Time constraints: Each task should be finished within 45-90 minutes** (increased from basic level).
- At every time pick different real-world scenario from the list provided above to ensure variety in task generation.
- **Expected technical depth**: Implementation should require understanding of App Router, Server Components vs Client Components, data fetching strategies, TypeScript generics, custom hooks, error boundaries, and performance optimization.
- Complete app route structure should be included when we are not expecting the user to implement app route structure or when already a complex implementation is expected from the user.

## TASK NAME:
- The task name should be consive
## Starter Code Instructions:
- The starter code should only provide starting directions so that the candidate is not clueless to begin with.
- The code files generated must be valid and executable with `npm run dev`.
- **For intermediate level**: Provide a more comprehensive project structure with multiple files, but leave the core business logic, complex components, and advanced features unimplemented.
- A part of the task completion is to watch the candidate implement best practices, design the solution correctly and not just fix the errors, so make sure the starter code leaves room for the candidate to implement the solution the way they want.
- **If the task is to fix bugs**: Make sure the starter code has logical bugs that require understanding of Next.js lifecycle, TypeScript type issues, or architectural problems (not just syntactic errors).
- **If the task is to implement a feature from scratch**: Provide a solid foundation with proper project structure, but leave the complex implementations for the candidate.
- **Advanced setup expectations**: Include configurations for TypeScript strict mode, proper Next.js App Router structure, and modern development tools.

# OUTPUT

The output should be a valid json schema:
  - README.md (CRITICAL - Follow exact structure specified below)
  - package.json (Node.js dependencies including Next.js 14+, TypeScript, React, and other dependencies required in the scenario)
  - tsconfig.json (TypeScript configuration optimized for Next.js with strict mode enabled)
  - next.config.js (Next.js configuration file with intermediate-level configurations)
  - .gitignore (Ignore node_modules/, .next/, out/, .env*.local, *.log, .DS_Store)
  - tailwind.config.js (if styling with Tailwind CSS is required)
  - **Multiple code files** that provide a solid foundation but require significant implementation from the candidate
  - Code files should not contain solution hints but should demonstrate proper project architecture
