      "role_context": "A software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Go (Golang) and Redis is expected to develop small backend features and integrate Redis for basic caching, key-value storage, or background operations. They should be comfortable building and running Go applications using `go build`, `go run`, and `go test`. The engineer should understand Go fundamentals — including slices, maps, structs, and interfaces — and apply these effectively when developing services. They should also know how to use Redis for common use cases such as caching responses, storing temporary data, and managing simple counters or sessions. Under the guidance of senior developers, they should be capable of implementing small REST APIs, handling environment-based configurations, and using goroutines or channels for basic asynchronous tasks. The engineer should also be familiar with logging, simple error handling, and connecting to Redis using a Go client library (e.g., `go-redis`).",
      "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s understanding of Go fundamentals, basic Redis integration, and simple asynchronous operations using goroutines.\n\n- **Basic Go Programming and API Development**: The candidate should demonstrate knowledge of Go basics, including structs, interfaces, and maps. They should know how to write small REST APIs using Go’s `net/http` package or a framework such as Gin or Fiber.\n\n- **Redis Fundamentals**: The candidate should understand how Redis works as an in-memory key-value store. They should be able to explain or demonstrate simple operations such as setting and getting keys, handling TTL (expiration), and deleting cached data using a Go Redis client library.\n\n- **Asynchronous and Concurrent Operations**: The candidate should understand how to use goroutines and channels to handle lightweight background tasks such as caching data, refreshing keys, or processing API requests concurrently. They should be able to explain when concurrency helps improve response time.\n\n- **Error Handling and Resource Management**: The candidate should demonstrate proper error handling when connecting to Redis, handling network errors, and ensuring clean shutdowns. They should be aware of how to prevent goroutine leaks or blocking behavior in basic concurrent workflows.\n\n- **Performance and Caching Awareness**: The candidate should understand how caching with Redis can reduce latency and load on APIs. They should be able to identify common mistakes like stale data or missing key expiration and suggest simple ways to handle them.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can write basic Go applications that integrate Redis effectively, handle small concurrent tasks safely, and follow clean, maintainable development practices suitable for production environments under supervision.",
