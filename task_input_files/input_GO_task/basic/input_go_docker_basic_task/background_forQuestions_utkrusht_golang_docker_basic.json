      "role_context": "A software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Go and Docker is expected to develop small to medium backend services and package them into containerized environments for reliable deployment. They should be comfortable building Go applications using `go build`, `go run`, and `go test`, and running them inside Docker containers. The engineer should understand Docker basics — writing simple Dockerfiles, using Docker Compose for multi-container setups, and managing images and containers using the CLI. They should also follow Go’s idiomatic practices for writing clean, efficient code, use goroutines and channels for lightweight concurrency, and know how to expose Go APIs through containers. Under guidance, they should be able to troubleshoot basic build and runtime issues, handle simple Docker networking, and optimize container usage for development workflows.",
      
      "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s understanding of Docker fundamentals and Go service containerization at a beginner to intermediate level.\n\n- **Basic Go Application Containerization**: The candidate should demonstrate how to containerize a simple Go application using a Dockerfile. They should understand how to copy binaries, expose ports, and define the container entrypoint. They should also know how to run and test containers locally using Docker CLI commands.\n\n- **Docker Image and Container Basics**: The candidate should be able to explain the difference between images, containers, and layers. They should know basic commands such as `docker build`, `docker run`, `docker ps`, and `docker logs`, and describe how Docker manages application dependencies and environments.\n\n- **Using Docker Compose for Go Services**: The candidate should understand how to use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications (e.g., a Go service and a PostgreSQL database). They should be able to configure environment variables, volume mounts, and basic networking between services.\n\n- **Concurrency and Resource Awareness in Go Containers**: The candidate should be able to explain how goroutines and channels enable concurrency in Go applications and how this behavior interacts with Docker’s resource constraints (e.g., CPU and memory limits). They should understand the importance of graceful shutdown and proper resource cleanup within containers.\n\n- **Troubleshooting and Optimization Basics**: The candidate should know how to debug common container issues such as failed builds, port conflicts, or environment variable misconfigurations. They should demonstrate awareness of image optimization techniques like using smaller base images (e.g., `golang:alpine`) and reducing unnecessary layers.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can develop and containerize simple Go services effectively, applying good coding and containerization practices to ensure reliable, portable, and maintainable deployments.",
