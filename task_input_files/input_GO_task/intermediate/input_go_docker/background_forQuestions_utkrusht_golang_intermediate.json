      "role_context": "A software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Go and Docker is expected to design, build, and deploy production-ready Go services using containerized environments. They should have strong command over Docker fundamentals, multi-stage builds, image optimization, and service orchestration with Docker Compose or container clusters. The engineer should write idiomatic and efficient Go code, handle concurrency patterns with goroutines and channels, and ensure robust error handling and logging within containers. They should be comfortable designing Dockerized microservices that communicate over networks, manage environment-based configurations securely, and integrate with external services like databases or message queues. Additionally, they are expected to profile container performance, reduce build times, and ensure minimal image footprint while maintaining scalability and reliability under load.",
      
      "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s depth of understanding in containerization, service orchestration, and performance optimization in Dockerized Go environments.\n\n- **Advanced Dockerfile and Image Optimization**: The candidate should demonstrate proficiency in writing efficient multi-stage Dockerfiles, minimizing image size, and reducing build context. They should understand how build caching works, when to use `.dockerignore`, and how to optimize Go builds for smaller, faster images (e.g., using `scratch` or `alpine` as base images).\n\n- **Container Networking and Environment Management**: The candidate should understand how Docker manages internal networking, DNS resolution, and communication between multiple services. They should know how to configure environment variables, secrets, and volumes securely within Compose or Docker Swarm setups.\n\n- **Concurrency and Performance Profiling in Containers**: The candidate should be able to discuss how goroutines and channels behave under constrained container resources, and how to profile and optimize Go applications inside containers using tools like `pprof` or runtime metrics. They should also know how to handle graceful shutdowns using OS signals (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`) to ensure clean exits in containerized apps.\n\n- **Docker Compose and Microservice Integration**: The candidate should have hands-on experience defining multi-container environments using Docker Compose — connecting Go services with databases, caches, or message queues. They should be able to describe how to handle dependency ordering, health checks, and environment isolation between services.\n\n- **Production-Grade Practices and Deployment Awareness**: The candidate should understand image tagging strategies, versioning, and container security basics (e.g., non-root users, minimizing privileges). They should be familiar with Docker registry workflows, CI/CD pipelines involving container builds, and common production issues like container crashes, scaling limits, and log management.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate how effectively the candidate can design, build, and optimize scalable Go applications using Docker, ensuring maintainable, performant, and production-grade containerized deployments.",
