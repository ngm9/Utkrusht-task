    "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 0–3 years of experience working with FastAPI and PostgreSQL is expected to work on a simple FastAPI application where the basic project structure and routing are already set up. Their main responsibility is to implement straightforward database operations — including creating simple tables with appropriate data types, writing basic CRUD queries, and adding essential indexes to improve performance. The FastAPI codebase provides the foundational structure, and the engineer is required to write and test basic database integration code using either synchronous (psycopg2) or simple async (asyncpg) approaches. This includes performing common SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), understanding when to use transactions, applying basic indexing strategies (single-column and simple composite B-tree indexes), and using EXPLAIN to verify query performance. The engineer should be able to connect the database with FastAPI endpoints, handle basic errors with try-except blocks, implement simple Pydantic models for request/response validation, and recognize common performance issues like missing indexes, N+1 queries, or retrieving unnecessary columns. While guidance on complex architectural decisions may be needed, the engineer is expected to write functional, correct database code that integrates properly with the provided FastAPI routes.",

  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate's ability to work within a simple FastAPI application where the basic routing structure is already provided. The candidate's task is to focus on implementing fundamental PostgreSQL operations, creating basic table schemas, and writing straightforward database logic to support the API endpoints. - Basic Database Operations: They should be comfortable writing standard SQL queries (SELECT with WHERE, JOIN, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and executing them through Python database drivers (psycopg2 or asyncpg) within FastAPI route handlers. - Simple Schema Design: Candidates should be able to create tables with appropriate data types (INTEGER, VARCHAR, TEXT, TIMESTAMP, BOOLEAN, JSONB, UUID), define primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and understand basic normalization concepts for simple applications. - Essential Indexing: They should recognize when to add single-column or simple composite B-tree indexes to improve query performance, and use EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE in psql to verify index usage and identify sequential scans. - Basic Async Awareness: They should understand the difference between synchronous and asynchronous database calls in FastAPI, and be able to implement simple async endpoints using async/await with an async database driver, though deep concurrency optimization is not expected. - Connection Management: Candidates should implement basic connection pooling or connection reuse patterns to avoid creating new connections for every request, and handle simple connection errors appropriately. - Request/Response Handling: They should use Pydantic models for basic input validation and response serialization, implement appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 500), and add try-except blocks for database error handling. - Common Performance Issues: They should be able to identify and fix typical problems such as missing indexes, N+1 query patterns, selecting unnecessary columns (SELECT * instead of specific fields), lack of pagination (missing LIMIT/OFFSET), and sequential queries that could be combined. - Transaction Basics: They should understand when to use BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK for simple multi-step operations and be able to use INSERT...RETURNING to reduce query roundtrips. The emphasis is on writing correct, functional database code with fundamental optimization techniques, not on advanced architectural patterns or complex query optimization.",
