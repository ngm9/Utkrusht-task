        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Python-FastAPI as a competency should be able to or is capable of using fundamental Python features (including data types, control flow, and environment management) to build and maintain small FastAPI services, confidently structure projects using routers and Pydantic models for data validation and serialization, handle common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) with path and query parameters, employ basic async/await in endpoints without deep concurrency optimization, configure and run local FastAPI services with uvicorn/hypercorn while troubleshooting common errors and logging, implement simple authentication or token-based approaches and handle environment variables securely, use Docker to containerize applications for small-scale deployments (e.g., Heroku or a VPS), incorporate foundational security measures such as CORSMiddleware and create simple custom middleware, write basic unit and integration tests with pytest and FastAPI’s test client, use Git for source control and maintain minimal documentation, and demonstrate elementary awareness of performance and scalability concepts—primarily focusing on correct CRUD implementations and fundamental best practices at a small scale."

        "name": "PostgreSQL",
        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in PostgreSQL as a competency should be able to install and configure a single-node cluster on Linux or Windows using official packages, initialise a cluster, apply minor upgrades, tune port/listen_addresses/shared_buffers/work_mem and secure connections via pg_hba.conf, SSL/TLS or SCRAM. They comfortably use psql plus GUI tools such as pgAdmin or DBeaver, connect applications through psycopg2, JDBC, Npgsql or pgx drivers and resolve simple pool or connection-string issues. They write solid SQL—SELECT with WHERE, LIMIT/OFFSET, aliases, INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/CROSS joins, GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions (ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER), scalar and set-returning functions—and interpret EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN ANALYZE to distinguish seq vs index scans and join types. They create/alter/drop databases, schemas, tables, materialised views, sequences, B-tree indexes (single, composite, INCLUDE, partial) plus check, primary-key, unique and foreign-key constraints, choose correct data types (numeric, text, boolean, timestamp [tz/no-tz], JSON, UUID) and perform safe online ALTERs. They run INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE with RETURNING, bulk-load via COPY, manage transactions with BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK and savepoints, and understand ACID and default READ COMMITTED. They examine pg_locks, use NOWAIT/SKIP LOCKED, apply advisory locks and handle basic concurrency conflicts. They administer roles (CREATE ROLE, LOGIN, membership, limited SUPERUSER awareness), GRANT/REVOKE privileges, manage search_path, pg_hba.conf rules, and grasp row-level security concepts. They execute pg_dump/pg_dumpall/pg_restore, scripted base-backup + WAL point-in-time recovery, and maintain VACUUM, ANALYZE, autovacuum via pg_stat_user_tables. They observe performance with pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_database, pg_stat_statements, tweak work_mem, maintenance_work_mem, effective_cache_size, checkpoint_timeout and escalate complex issues with evidence. They write simple PL/pgSQL functions or procedures, tag IMMUTABLE/STABLE/VOLATILE, use SECURITY DEFINER/INVOKER, implement triggers for audit columns, and manage extensions like pg_stat_statements, hstore, uuid-ossp, citext through CREATE/ALTER EXTENSION and shared_preload_libraries. Finally, they understand the wider ecosystem (client libraries, ORMs, shell/cron automation) and follow disciplined naming, migration, documentation, incident reproduction and collaborative escalation practices."
