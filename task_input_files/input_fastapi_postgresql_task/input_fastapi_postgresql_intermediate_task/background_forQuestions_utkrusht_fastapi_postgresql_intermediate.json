    "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in both FastAPI and PostgreSQL is expected to work on an already implemented FastAPI application. Their main responsibility is to handle all aspects of the PostgreSQL database logic — including designing or modifying schemas, fixing existing database-related bugs, and optimizing query performance. The FastAPI codebase is already fully set up, and the engineer is required to write, debug, and improve the database integration logic without altering the API layer. This includes ensuring efficient asynchronous DB access, applying best practices in schema design, indexing, and query optimization to support scalable and performant application behavior. While high-level architectural support may be provided, the engineer is expected to independently deliver robust, production-ready database code that seamlessly integrates with the existing FastAPI endpoints.",
    "yoe": "1-2",
   "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s ability to work within a fully integrated FastAPI application where the project scaffolding and routing structure are already in place. The candidate's task is to focus on implementing PostgreSQL database schemas, defining relationships, and writing async-compatible logic to interact with the database. - Asynchronous DB Operations: They should be familiar with performing non-blocking database interactions within FastAPI routes and background tasks, understanding how to manage connections and avoid blocking the event loop. - Schema Design and Relationships: Candidates should be able to design efficient and normalized PostgreSQL schemas with appropriate keys, constraints, and relationships suited for real-world application domains. - Background Tasks and Integration: They should understand how to connect background tasks with the database for non-critical or deferred operations such as sending emails, logging, or processing uploads. - Performance Optimization: They should recognize and resolve common bottlenecks such as inefficient queries, missing indexes, or unbounded concurrency, especially in async-aware environments. The emphasis is on practical database design and logic integration, not setting up FastAPI itself "
