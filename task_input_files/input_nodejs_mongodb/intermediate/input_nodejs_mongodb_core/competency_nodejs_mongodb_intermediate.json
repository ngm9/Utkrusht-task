        "scope": "This individual has a strong grasp of JavaScript fundamentals (ES6+ syntax, event loop, async/await) and Node core modules (fs, http, crypto), and manages dependencies with npm or yarn. They build RESTful APIs using Express (or frameworks like Koa/Fastify), handle routing, middleware, error handling, and design data models for SQL/NoSQL databases (via ORM/ODM tools such as Sequelize or Mongoose), including transactions and concurrency. They separate application concerns for maintainability, implement caching (e.g., Redis), address security concerns (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection), and handle authentication/authorization (JWT, OAuth). They set up structured logging (Winston, Pino), monitor errors, and are comfortable deploying on AWS, GCP, or Azure, often using Docker containers and following 12-Factor App principles. They incorporate CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab), write unit and integration tests (Mocha, Jest), and use debugging/profiling tools to optimize performance. They manage code in Git with branching, merging, rebasing, and give/receive feedback through code reviews. They have a solid understanding of environment variable management across multiple stages and are open to learning advanced features like cluster modules, microservices, or event-driven architectures. They are familiar with other Node frameworks (NestJS, Koa, Fastify) and can become productive quickly thanks to strong fundamentals. Typically, they have 3–6 years of hands-on Node.js experience, are stronger than a beginner or basic-level developer, but not yet as deep as advanced or expert. They show a readiness to handle real-world production complexities, while still benefiting from guidance on highly specialized or complex scenarios."

        "scope": "A person with INTERMEDIATE proficiency level in MongoDB as a competency should be able to design production-grade schemas using embedded vs referenced docs, polymorphic, bucket, subset, time-series and extended-reference patterns, apply JSON-Schema validation and respect 16 MB, nesting, field and index limits while balancing read/write trade-offs. They fluently write CRUD and aggregation pipelines ($match, $project, $group, $bucket, $facet, $lookup, $unionWith, $graphLookup, $reduce, $setWindowFields), leverage update operators and arrayFilters, optimise with explain plans, covered queries, early $match, range/seek pagination, $text, Atlas Search and 2dsphere geospatial queries, and manage tailable, change-stream and awaitData cursors. They craft and tune compound, multikey, hashed, partial, sparse, TTL, hidden and reshard-compatible indexes, apply hinting, analyse indexUsageStats, profiler, serverStatus, FTDC and WiredTiger cache/compression/journaling settings. They run multi-document transactions with proper readConcern/writeConcern, retryable reads/writes, idempotency, session lifetime controls and understand lock hierarchy. They deploy and administer replica sets with primary/secondary/arbiter/hidden/delayed members, configure priorities, chained replication, tag-aware read preferences, perform rolling upgrades, step-downs and election/rollback drills. They operate sharded clusters (config servers, mongos routers, shard replica sets), select hashed/ranged/zone shard keys, monitor balancer, autosplit, jumbo chunks, and execute reshardCollection with minimal downtime. Security responsibilities cover SCRAM-SHA-256, LDAP proxy, x.509, TLS, VPC/IP whitelisting, custom RBAC roles, auditing, log redaction, FLE deterministic/random encryption and FIPS mode. They plan, automate and test backups via mongodump/restore, filesystem snapshots, Ops Manager, Atlas PITR, delayed secondaries, meeting RPO/RTO targets. Tooling mastery spans Compass, mongosh, legacy shell, Atlas UI/CLI, Ops/Cloud Manager, Terraform, Kubernetes Operator, Ansible, Helm, Docker, ODMs (Mongoose, Spring Data, PyMongo/Motor, C# LINQ, Go), Kafka & Spark Connectors, BI Connector, Realm Device Sync and Atlas Search. They automate index builds, schema migrations (mongomigrate, migrate-mongoose, Mongock), seed data, blue/green or canary upgrades, FCV toggling, and embed liveness/readiness probes in CI/CD. Observability includes Atlas/Ops dashboards, Prometheus-Grafana, threshold/percentile alerts, log parsing, FTDC capture, profiler/system.profile slow-query analysis and troubleshooting of chunk migrations, NotPrimary, DuplicateKey, WT cache and step-down issues. They execute data mobility via mongoimport/export, bsondump, AWS DMS, mongomirror, Atlas Live Migrate, Change Streams CDC, pipelines to Hadoop/Spark, Kafka, S3/GCS, maintain governance artefacts, runbooks, naming/index/backup policies and mentor juniors on best practices."
