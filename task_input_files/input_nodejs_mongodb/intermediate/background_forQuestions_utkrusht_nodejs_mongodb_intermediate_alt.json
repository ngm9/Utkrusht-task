       "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 2–4 years of experience in Node.js and MongoDB is expected to independently develop, extend, and maintain backend features within an existing Node.js application. They should be comfortable designing and evolving moderately complex MongoDB schemas, implementing well-structured Express.js APIs, and reasoning about data access patterns, performance, and reliability. The engineer should be able to refactor existing code for clarity and efficiency, handle asynchronous workflows confidently, and collaborate with senior engineers on architectural decisions rather than relying on constant guidance.",

"questions_prompt": "Please ensure the interview questions assess the candidate’s ability to work effectively with Node.js and MongoDB at an intermediate level:\n\n- **MongoDB Data Modeling & Queries**: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of document modeling, embedding vs. referencing, schema evolution, and the impact of these choices on query performance. They should be able to write and reason about queries beyond basic CRUD, including filtering, sorting, pagination, and simple aggregation stages.\n\n- **Asynchronous Control Flow in Node.js**: The candidate should be fluent in async/await and Promise-based patterns, explain how asynchronous execution works in Node.js, and handle concurrent operations within Express routes while avoiding common pitfalls such as unhandled rejections or race conditions.\n\n- **API Design & Express.js Practices**: The candidate should be able to design clean, maintainable RESTful APIs, structure middleware for concerns such as validation, authentication, and error handling, and explain how request lifecycles flow through an Express application.\n\n- **Error Handling, Validation & Edge Cases**: The candidate should explain strategies for input validation, consistent error responses, and safe handling of edge cases such as partial failures, missing documents, or conflicting updates.\n\n- **Performance & Reliability Considerations**: The candidate should understand the role of indexes, query efficiency, and connection management in MongoDB, and be able to identify common performance bottlenecks in Node.js APIs. They should demonstrate awareness of logging, monitoring, and graceful error handling in production environments.\n\n- **Working Within and Improving an Existing Codebase**: The candidate should show the ability to follow established conventions, refactor or extend existing modules safely, write readable and testable code, and communicate trade-offs or risks when proposing changes.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can take ownership of everyday backend development tasks, make informed technical decisions, and build reliable, maintainable Node.js and MongoDB services appropriate for an intermediate-level engineer.",
