        "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Node.js and MongoDB is expected to work on an existing Node.js application (using Express.js or a similar framework). Their main responsibility is to manage and optimize all aspects of MongoDB integration — including designing and modifying schemas, improving data models, fixing database-related issues, and ensuring high-performance queries. The Node.js application’s routing and API structure are already implemented, so the engineer should focus on enhancing database logic, ensuring efficient CRUD operations, and maintaining data integrity. They should be well-versed in asynchronous programming with Promises and async/await, understand MongoDB’s indexing and aggregation mechanisms, and apply best practices for schema design and query performance. While guidance on overall architecture may be provided, the engineer is expected to independently deliver reliable, optimized, and production-ready database solutions that integrate seamlessly with the existing API endpoints.",
        
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s ability to work within an existing Node.js codebase, focusing specifically on MongoDB schema design, data operations, and performance optimization:\n\n- **Asynchronous Data Operations**: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of asynchronous programming in Node.js, including handling non-blocking database operations using Promises or async/await. They should understand connection pooling, error handling, and avoiding common pitfalls like unhandled rejections or blocking I/O in async flows.\n\n- **Schema Design and Data Modeling**: The candidate should be able to design efficient MongoDB schemas using Mongoose or native MongoDB drivers, applying appropriate indexes, references, and embedded documents based on use cases. They should understand normalization vs. denormalization trade-offs and how to structure schemas for scalability.\n\n- **Aggregation and Query Optimization**: The candidate should be familiar with MongoDB’s aggregation framework and explain how to optimize queries using indexes, projections, and filtering. They should recognize and address performance bottlenecks such as unindexed lookups or large document scans.\n\n- **Integration and Background Tasks**: The candidate should understand how to link background or scheduled jobs (e.g., using Bull, Agenda, or Node Cron) with MongoDB for secondary processes like logging, cleanup, or analytics aggregation.\n\n- **Performance and Scalability Awareness**: The candidate should demonstrate awareness of best practices for scaling Node.js and MongoDB applications — including efficient query execution, index monitoring, connection reuse, and resource management in production environments.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can confidently design, optimize, and maintain MongoDB logic in a Node.js backend while ensuring reliability, scalability, and efficient asynchronous execution.",
