        "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Node.js and MongoDB is expected to contribute to an existing Node.js application by implementing small features, fixing minor bugs, and working with basic MongoDB operations. They should be comfortable writing simple Express.js routes, performing CRUD operations, and using async/await for non-blocking logic. The engineer is not expected to design complex schemas or advanced aggregation pipelines but should understand basic document structures, simple indexing, and how to safely read and write data to MongoDB. Under the guidance of senior developers, they should be able to write clean, maintainable code, handle common asynchronous patterns, and work within an already established codebase without modifying core architecture.",
        
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the interview questions evaluate the candidate’s ability to work with Node.js and MongoDB at a foundational level:\n\n- **Core Database Interactions**: The candidate should be able to perform essential CRUD operations and understand how MongoDB stores and retrieves JSON-like documents.\n\n- **Understanding of Async Patterns**: They should demonstrate fluency with async/await, basic Promise handling, and how asynchronous operations flow within Express routes.\n\n- **Simple Schema Modeling**: The candidate should know how to define basic models with required fields, default values, or simple validation using Mongoose or similar tools.\n\n- **Handling Errors and Edge Cases**: They should be able to explain how to manage common issues such as invalid payloads, missing documents, or malformed queries.\n\n- **Working Safely in an Existing Codebase**: The candidate should show the ability to extend existing modules, follow established conventions, and make small improvements without disrupting the application's structure.\n\nThe goal is to gauge whether the candidate can reliably contribute to everyday backend tasks involving Node.js and MongoDB while following good development practices suitable for a beginner-level engineer.",
