  "role_context": "A full-stack software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Node.js, React, and MongoDB is expected to contribute to an already established MERN-based application. Their primary responsibility is to implement and maintain backend logic in Node.js (Express or similar), design and optimize MongoDB schemas, and ensure seamless data flow between the backend API and the React frontend. The Node.js application structure and routing are already in place — the engineer is expected to extend, debug, and improve the backend logic without altering the existing architectural setup. This includes building new API endpoints, managing data models and relationships (where applicable), handling authentication flows, and integrating with the frontend efficiently. They should also ensure performance optimization in MongoDB queries, indexing, and caching, as well as maintain clean React component integration with the API. While high-level architectural guidance may be provided, the engineer is expected to independently deliver robust, production-ready code across both backend and frontend layers that ensures scalability, maintainability, and consistent user experience.",
  
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s ability to work within a Node.js + React + MongoDB stack where the foundational scaffolding and routing structure are already in place. The candidate’s focus should be on implementing robust backend logic, designing MongoDB schemas, and integrating API responses efficiently into the React frontend. - API Development and Integration: Evaluate their ability to build and enhance RESTful APIs using Express (or similar), ensuring correct routing, middleware usage, and secure data handling. - MongoDB Schema Design and Queries: Assess their knowledge of schema modeling, indexing strategies, aggregation pipelines, and performance optimization in a NoSQL environment. - Frontend Integration (React): Test their understanding of connecting React components with backend APIs using fetch or Axios, managing state efficiently (with hooks or context), and handling asynchronous UI updates. - Performance and Optimization: Gauge how well they can identify and resolve bottlenecks — such as slow MongoDB queries, inefficient React renders, or over-fetching of data. - Authentication and State Management: They should demonstrate practical understanding of implementing JWT-based authentication, securing routes, and maintaining session state between frontend and backend. The emphasis is on practical integration and performance across the MERN stack — not setting up the project structure, but building efficient, maintainable logic within it.",
