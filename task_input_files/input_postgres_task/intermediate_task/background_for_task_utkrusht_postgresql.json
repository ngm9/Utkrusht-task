    "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in PostgreSQL is expected to work on database logic for an existing application. Their main responsibility is to handle all aspects of the PostgreSQL database — including designing or modifying schemas, writing efficient queries, fixing database-related bugs, and optimizing query performance. The application codebase is already fully set up, and the engineer is required to write, debug, and improve the database logic without altering the application layer. This includes ensuring efficient database access, applying best practices in schema design, indexing, normalization, and query optimization to support scalable and performant application behavior. While high-level architectural support may be provided, the engineer is expected to independently deliver robust, production-ready database code that seamlessly integrates with the existing application endpoints.",
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate's ability to work with PostgreSQL in a production environment where the application infrastructure is already in place. The candidate's task is to focus on implementing PostgreSQL database schemas, defining relationships, writing efficient queries, and ensuring data integrity. Key areas to evaluate include:\n\n- Schema Design and Relationships: Candidates should be able to design efficient and normalized PostgreSQL schemas with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and indexes suited for real-world application domains.\n\n- Query Writing and Optimization: They should demonstrate proficiency in writing complex SQL queries including joins, aggregations, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions. They should also be able to identify and resolve query performance issues through EXPLAIN plans, proper indexing strategies, and query restructuring.\n\n- Data Integrity and Constraints: They should understand how to enforce business rules at the database level using constraints, triggers, and transactions to maintain data consistency.\n\n- Performance Optimization: They should recognize and resolve common bottlenecks such as missing indexes, inefficient query patterns, N+1 problems, excessive locking, and poor connection management.\n\n- Advanced PostgreSQL Features: Familiarity with PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB operations, full-text search, array types, materialized views, partitioning, and appropriate use of database functions and stored procedures.\n\nThe emphasis is on practical database design, SQL proficiency, and performance optimization, not on application framework setup or API development.",
