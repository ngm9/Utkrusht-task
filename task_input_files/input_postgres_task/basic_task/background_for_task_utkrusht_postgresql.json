    "role_context": "A backend software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in PostgreSQL is expected to assist in developing and maintaining the database components of an application. Their main responsibilities include creating and modifying tables, writing basic SQL queries, and ensuring data is stored and retrieved efficiently. The engineer will work under guidance from senior developers on schema design and optimization but should be capable of handling day-to-day database operations, debugging simple query issues, and maintaining data integrity. They should follow best practices in query writing, indexing basics, and relational database concepts while ensuring the database logic supports the application's requirements reliably.",
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s ability to work with PostgreSQL at a foundational level within an existing application setup. The focus should be on schema understanding, basic query writing, and maintaining data correctness. Key areas to evaluate include:\n\n- **Basic Schema Design and Relationships**: The candidate should understand how to create tables, define primary and foreign keys, and establish simple one-to-many or many-to-many relationships. They should be familiar with basic normalization concepts and column data types.\n\n- **SQL Query Fundamentals**: The candidate should demonstrate the ability to write basic SQL queries involving SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, WHERE clauses, and simple joins. They should understand how to use aggregate functions and basic filtering to extract meaningful data.\n\n- **Data Integrity and Constraints**: The candidate should know how to apply basic constraints like NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY to maintain consistency and reliability in the database.\n\n- **Basic Performance and Index Awareness**: The candidate should have a conceptual understanding of indexes, when they are useful, and how poorly written queries can impact performance. They should also understand the importance of avoiding redundant data and unnecessary computations in queries.\n\n- **Foundational PostgreSQL Features**: The candidate should be aware of PostgreSQL’s core features like data types, basic functions, simple views, and transactions for maintaining atomic operations.\n\nThe emphasis is on evaluating whether the candidate can effectively apply fundamental PostgreSQL concepts to build reliable database structures and queries under supervision.",
