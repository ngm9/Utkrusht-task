        "scope": "At the BASIC proficiency level in Node.js (0-3 years of experience), an individual understands what Node.js is, its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, and when to use it over other technologies, while having a solid grasp of JavaScript fundamentals like variables, data types, functions, control structures, and basic object-oriented programming concepts. They can install Node.js, set up a development environment, use the REPL, and work with core modules such as fs, http, path, and os, as well as create and export custom modules, manage packages with NPM, and understand the purpose of package.json. They are capable of writing simple Node.js scripts, building basic HTTP servers to handle requests and responses, implementing basic routing, performing file system operations using the fs module, and creating simple command-line applications. They understand and use callbacks to handle asynchronous operations, utilize the EventEmitter for event handling, and work with timers like setTimeout and setInterval. They can parse and stringify JSON data, handle errors using try...catch blocks and in callbacks, and use console.log() for debugging purposes. They may have introductory exposure to Express.js for setting up basic web servers and handling routes, and understand the concept of middleware. They use Git for basic version control tasks, run Node.js applications locally, and navigate the file system, run scripts, and manage packages via the command line. However, they are not equipped to design complex architectures or systems, have limited understanding of Promises and async/await, advanced asynchronous patterns, performance optimization, security best practices, advanced debugging techniques, and integrating databases like MongoDB or MySQL with Node.js applications."

        "name": "PostgreSQL",
        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in PostgreSQL as a competency should be able to install and configure a single-node cluster on Linux or Windows using official packages, initialise a cluster, apply minor upgrades, tune port/listen_addresses/shared_buffers/work_mem and secure connections via pg_hba.conf, SSL/TLS or SCRAM. They comfortably use psql plus GUI tools such as pgAdmin or DBeaver, connect applications through psycopg2, JDBC, Npgsql or pgx drivers and resolve simple pool or connection-string issues. They write solid SQL—SELECT with WHERE, LIMIT/OFFSET, aliases, INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/CROSS joins, GROUP BY, HAVING, window functions (ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER), scalar and set-returning functions—and interpret EXPLAIN/EXPLAIN ANALYZE to distinguish seq vs index scans and join types. They create/alter/drop databases, schemas, tables, materialised views, sequences, B-tree indexes (single, composite, INCLUDE, partial) plus check, primary-key, unique and foreign-key constraints, choose correct data types (numeric, text, boolean, timestamp [tz/no-tz], JSON, UUID) and perform safe online ALTERs. They run INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE with RETURNING, bulk-load via COPY, manage transactions with BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK and savepoints, and understand ACID and default READ COMMITTED. They examine pg_locks, use NOWAIT/SKIP LOCKED, apply advisory locks and handle basic concurrency conflicts. They administer roles (CREATE ROLE, LOGIN, membership, limited SUPERUSER awareness), GRANT/REVOKE privileges, manage search_path, pg_hba.conf rules, and grasp row-level security concepts. They execute pg_dump/pg_dumpall/pg_restore, scripted base-backup + WAL point-in-time recovery, and maintain VACUUM, ANALYZE, autovacuum via pg_stat_user_tables. They observe performance with pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_database, pg_stat_statements, tweak work_mem, maintenance_work_mem, effective_cache_size, checkpoint_timeout and escalate complex issues with evidence. They write simple PL/pgSQL functions or procedures, tag IMMUTABLE/STABLE/VOLATILE, use SECURITY DEFINER/INVOKER, implement triggers for audit columns, and manage extensions like pg_stat_statements, hstore, uuid-ossp, citext through CREATE/ALTER EXTENSION and shared_preload_libraries. Finally, they understand the wider ecosystem (client libraries, ORMs, shell/cron automation) and follow disciplined naming, migration, documentation, incident reproduction and collaborative escalation practices."
