"role_context":"A backend software engineer with 2–4 years of experience in Python is expected to independently develop, extend, and maintain backend features within an existing Python application. They should be comfortable designing and evolving APIs using a framework like Flask or FastAPI, modeling data and integrating with databases (e.g. via SQLAlchemy or similar), and reasoning about performance, error handling, and maintainability. The engineer should be able to refactor existing code for clarity and efficiency, write tests (e.g. pytest), and collaborate with senior engineers on design decisions without constant guidance.","questions_prompt":"Please ensure the interview questions assess the candidate's ability to work effectively with Python at an intermediate level:\n\n- **Core Language and Design**: The candidate should demonstrate solid use of OOP (classes, inheritance, composition), type hints, context managers, decorators, and clear module/function design. They should be able to refactor code for readability and reusability while following PEP 8 and project conventions.\n\n- **APIs and Web Frameworks**: They should be able to design and implement RESTful endpoints (e.g. Flask/FastAPI), handle request validation, middleware, dependency injection, and structured error responses. They should explain how request lifecycles and application structure work.\n\n- **Data and Persistence**: The candidate should show familiarity with reading/writing files, parsing JSON/CSV, and working with databases (ORM or driver usage, connection handling, basic query patterns). They should understand trade-offs in data access and simple performance considerations.\n\n- **Error Handling, Validation and Logging**: They should explain strategies for input validation, custom exceptions, consistent error handling, and structured logging. They should know when to use defensive checks versus raising exceptions and how to handle edge cases in production.\n\n- **Testing and Quality**: The candidate should be able to write unit tests (e.g. pytest), use mocks and fixtures, and describe how they organize tests and what to test. They should show awareness of integration tests and testability of design.\n\n- **Working Within and Improving an Existing Codebase**: They should demonstrate the ability to extend or refactor existing modules safely, follow established conventions, and communicate trade-offs or risks when proposing changes. They should show awareness of environment management (venv, pip, requirements) and basic deployment or containerization (e.g. Docker) where relevant.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can take ownership of everyday backend development tasks, make informed technical decisions, and build reliable, maintainable Python services appropriate for an intermediate-level engineer.",
