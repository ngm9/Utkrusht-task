"scope":"A person with INTERMEDIATE proficiency in Python has a solid grasp of the language beyond basics. They design and implement maintainable code using clear OOP (classes, inheritance, composition, encapsulation), use type hints and docstrings, and follow PEP 8 and project conventions. They write and refactor functions and modules for reusability, use list/dict comprehensions, generators, context managers, and decorators appropriately. They work confidently with web frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI: defining routes, middleware, request/response handling, validation (e.g. Pydantic), and basic dependency injection. They handle errors with structured try/except, custom exceptions, and logging; they understand when to validate input defensively versus raising exceptions. They read and write files, parse and serialize JSON/CSV, and integrate with databases via ORMs (e.g. SQLAlchemy) or drivers with connection handling. They write unit tests (e.g. pytest), use mocks and fixtures, and have basic awareness of integration tests and test organization. They use virtual environments (venv, pip, requirements.txt), understand dependency management, and may use Docker for local or deployment workflows. They use Git for branching, merging, and code reviews, and can extend or refactor an existing codebase without breaking existing behavior. They have some awareness of performance (e.g. N+1 queries, algorithmic complexity) and production concerns like configuration, environment variables, and basic security (input sanitization, secrets). They typically have 2–4 years of hands-on Python experience, can own features end-to-end with limited guidance, and are ready for production-level backend development while still growing in architecture and scaling."}]
