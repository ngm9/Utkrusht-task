  "role_context": "A backend engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Python, FastAPI, and Redis is expected to design and implement scalable, high-performance APIs and caching layers. They should be comfortable working with asynchronous I/O in FastAPI, integrating Redis for caching or background task queues, and optimizing application performance. The engineer is responsible for writing production-grade, well-tested code, handling real-time data efficiently, and ensuring fault tolerance and observability within the service.",
  
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Asynchronous Programming, Caching Strategies, and Background Task Processing in the context of Python (FastAPI) and Redis:\n\n- **Asynchronous Programming and Concurrency**: The candidate should demonstrate a solid understanding of Python’s async/await model and how FastAPI leverages it for concurrent request handling. They should know how to structure async endpoints, manage database calls asynchronously, and avoid common pitfalls such as blocking I/O in async routes.\n\n- **Caching and Redis Integration**: The candidate should explain or implement Redis caching patterns for improving performance — for example, storing query results, session data, or rate-limiting counters. They should understand cache invalidation strategies, expiration handling, and using Redis both as a cache and as a lightweight message broker.\n\n- **Background Processing and Task Queues**: The candidate should demonstrate how to offload long-running tasks using Redis-based queues (e.g., RQ, Celery with Redis, or asyncio background tasks). They should be able to implement retry logic, error handling, and proper logging for background jobs.\n\n- **Performance and Monitoring Awareness**: The candidate should show understanding of how to monitor API performance, identify latency sources, and leverage Redis metrics or FastAPI’s middleware for tracing and logging.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can design and implement reliable, asynchronous, and performant FastAPI services that effectively utilize Redis for caching and background task management.",
