        "name": "Python - Pandas",
        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Python - Pandas as a competency should be able to understand and correctly use Series, DataFrame, Index objects, standard dtypes (int, float, bool, object, category, datetime64[ns], timedelta), vectorized operations versus Python loops, and avoid common copy-vs-view pitfalls. They should ingest data with read_csv, read_table, read_fwf, read_excel, read_json, read_html or read_clipboard, stream large files via chunksize, and export clean results with to_csv, to_excel or to_json while controlling delimiter, header, dtype, compression and append modes. They must profile and explore datasets using head, tail, sample, shape, dtypes, info, describe, value_counts, nunique, memory_usage, display.* options, isna/notna, duplicated/drop_duplicates for basic data-quality checks. They should select and filter data with loc, iloc, at, iat, boolean masks, isin, between, query, and manage indexes by set_index/reset_index, sort_index/sort_values and rename. They clean data via dropna, fillna (scalar, ffill, bfill), interpolate, .str operations (strip, lower, contains, replace, split, extract), type conversions (to_numeric, to_datetime, to_timedelta), column/row insertion and deletion through assign, insert, drop. They perform elementary transformations: arithmetic with alignment/broadcasting and fill_value, groupby aggregation (count, sum, mean, min, max, size), rolling or expanding stats, concat/append, melt, pivot, pivot_table, and merge/join (inner, left, right, outer) both row-wise and column-wise. They handle time data with pd.to_datetime, DatetimeIndex, resample, timedelta math, and optimize string columns with categorical dtype. They generate quick visuals using the pandas .plot API backed by matplotlib, adjusting figure size, titles, labels and saving outputs. They code mainly in Jupyter Notebook/Lab, PyCharm or VS Code, manage environments with conda/virtualenv/pip, rely on NumPy, matplotlib and seaborn side-by-side, and follow linting/formatting via flake8 or black. They document logic with comments/docstrings, write simple assertions using pandas.testing.assert_frame_equal, time snippets with %timeit, inspect memory_usage, and recognize when dask, polars or PySpark may be needed. They understand pandas fits in RAM, sample or chunk large files, and avoid Python for-loops over rows whenever vectorization exists. Ultimately they can, with minimal supervision, deliver a reproducible notebook or script that ingests raw files, cleans and reshapes them, and outputs a tidy DataFrame or CSV/Excel/JSON ready for downstream analytics."

        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Python - NumPy as a competency should be able to create, index, and slice NumPy arrays to handle everyday data manipulation. They should be familiar with fundamental data types (float, int, boolean) and use them effectively in arrays. They can perform basic transformations such as reshape, transpose, and concatenate, as well as utilize universal functions (e.g., np.mean, np.sum) for descriptive analytics. They have some exposure to broadcasting for simpler element-wise operations and can write basic vectorized expressions for modest performance improvements. They can apply boolean indexing and mask arrays for selecting subsets of data based on clear-cut conditions relevant to BFSI analytics. They troubleshoot typical shape mismatches or type mismatches using simple debugging approaches. They are aware of NumPy’s performance benefits over native Python lists but need guidance for more advanced optimizations. They can incorporate NumPy arrays in smaller data pipelines and ETL tasks under straightforward scenarios. They frequently consult official NumPy documentation or online tutorials, especially when facing new challenges. They also exhibit a nascent understanding of BFSI-specific best practices around handling sensitive data, though they defer to more seasoned colleagues for deeper or more complex guidance."
