        "role_context": "A software engineer or data practitioner with 1–2 years of experience using Pandas and NumPy is expected to perform basic data cleaning, simple transformations, and exploratory analysis. They should be comfortable loading datasets, selecting and filtering rows/columns, applying vectorized operations, handling missing values, and performing basic aggregations. The engineer should understand fundamental NumPy array operations, indexing, broadcasting, and how NumPy underpins many Pandas operations. They may require guidance for more complex manipulations but should be able to work independently on small data-processing tasks and write clean, readable code.",
        
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover foundational Pandas and NumPy operations, basic data manipulation, and entry-level analytical thinking:\n\n- **Pandas Fundamentals**: The candidate should understand how to read CSV/JSON files into DataFrames, inspect data, select/filter columns and rows, handle missing values, and perform basic aggregations using `groupby`, `agg`, and summary statistics.\n\n- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: They should know how to apply simple transformations such as renaming columns, type conversions, dropping duplicates, merging/joining DataFrames, and creating new columns using vectorized Pandas operations.\n\n- **NumPy Basics**: The candidate should understand how to create and manipulate NumPy arrays, use slicing and indexing, perform basic arithmetic operations, and apply simple broadcasting rules.\n\n- **Performance Awareness**: They should understand when vectorization is beneficial, why loops should often be avoided, and how Pandas uses NumPy under the hood for efficient operations.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can perform foundational data manipulation tasks, use Pandas and NumPy effectively for basic analysis, and write clear, correct, and efficient transformation logic under supervision.",
