        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Docker (1–2 years experience) can use Docker to build, run, and manage containers, images, volumes, and networks. They understand the Docker architecture and how to use Docker CLI commands to interact with Docker Engine. They can create Dockerfiles to build images, use .dockerignore to control build context, and create and manage Docker Compose files to run multi-container apps. They are familiar with container lifecycle, port mapping, basic networking, service linking, and basic security practices like not running containers as root and using smaller base images. They are not yet proficient with multi-stage builds, image optimization, advanced Compose features like healthchecks, secrets, or profiles, or production orchestration like Swarm/Kubernetes. They do not handle overlay networks, service discovery, container runtime hardening, or image vulnerability scanning. Their usage is typically limited to dev/test environments and they still rely on structured guidance for architecture or debugging complex container interactions."
