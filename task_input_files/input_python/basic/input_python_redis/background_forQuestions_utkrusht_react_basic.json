  "role_context": "A backend engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Python, FastAPI, and Redis is expected to implement basic APIs, integrate caching mechanisms, and understand how asynchronous requests improve performance. They should be able to write clean, readable, and testable code while following RESTful design principles. The engineer will typically work under the guidance of senior developers for architectural and optimization decisions but should be able to build small modules, set up Redis connections, and handle basic caching or background tasks independently.",
  
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Asynchronous Basics, API Design, and Simple Redis Usage in the context of Python (FastAPI) and Redis:\n\n- **Asynchronous Programming Fundamentals**: The candidate should understand how FastAPI uses async/await for non-blocking I/O operations. They should be able to write basic asynchronous endpoints that fetch or process data without blocking the main thread and understand when to use synchronous vs asynchronous functions.\n\n- **Basic Redis Integration**: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of how Redis can be used for simple caching scenarios, such as storing frequently accessed data or session tokens. They should be able to connect FastAPI with Redis, set and retrieve basic key-value pairs, and configure expiration times.\n\n- **Background Tasks and Job Handling**: The candidate should know how to run simple background jobs in FastAPI using BackgroundTasks or Redis queues for non-critical operations such as sending notifications or refreshing cache entries.\n\n- **Error Handling and Logging Basics**: The candidate should show awareness of how to handle Redis connection errors gracefully, log events properly, and ensure smooth API responses even when cache data is unavailable.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can build basic, reliable, and asynchronous FastAPI endpoints that integrate with Redis for simple caching and background task handling under supervision.",
