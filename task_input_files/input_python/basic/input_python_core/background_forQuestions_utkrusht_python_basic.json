We help aspiring professionals improve their profile with continuous improvement in their skills, documenting their journey and helping them fulfill their potential. We primarily build, conduct, proctor and disseminate proof-of-skill assessments in Technical domains like AI, ML, Fullstack development, High scale distributed systems, DevOps etc but do help non-tech roles like Sales, HR, Marketing etc"},"role_context":"A developer with 1–2 years of experience in Python is expected to implement features and fix bugs in existing codebases. They should write clean functions and simple classes, use standard library modules, handle errors with try/except, and write basic tests. They may work with file I/O, JSON, or simple APIs under guidance. They are not yet expected to design complex systems or lead architecture; the focus is on readable, maintainable code and following existing patterns.","questions_prompt":"Please ensure the questions assess the candidate's ability at Python basic level (1–2 years) only: - **Functions & Modules**: The candidate should structure code with functions, use and create modules, and follow basic packaging or import conventions. - **OOP Basics**: The candidate should define classes with __init__, instance methods, and simple inheritance where appropriate. - **Error Handling**: The candidate should use try/except/finally, raise and catch appropriate exceptions, and avoid swallowing errors. - **Data Structures & Standard Library**: The candidate should use list comprehensions, dict operations, collections (e.g. defaultdict, Counter) when useful, and work with json, os, pathlib, or similar. - **Testing & Readability**: The candidate should write or interpret simple unit tests (e.g. unittest or pytest) and write readable, maintainable code. The goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can implement or fix well-scoped features using these fundamental Python concepts—without requiring advanced concurrency, metaprogramming, or framework-specific expertise.","yoe":"1-2"}
