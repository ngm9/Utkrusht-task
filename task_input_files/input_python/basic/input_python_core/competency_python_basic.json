They structure code with modules and packages, define classes with __init__ and instance methods, and use simple inheritance. They handle errors with try/except/finally, raise and catch appropriate exceptions, and write readable code. They use list comprehensions, common dict operations, and standard library modules (e.g. json, os, pathlib, collections). They can write or work with simple unit tests (unittest or pytest) and follow existing code style and conventions. They may work with file I/O, CSV/JSON, or simple HTTP requests. They are not yet expected to design complex systems, use advanced concurrency, or apply metaprogramming or framework-specific patterns at an intermediate level."}]
