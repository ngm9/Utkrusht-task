They should be comfortable writing simple endpoints or scripts using a framework like Flask or FastAPI, performing basic file and data operations, and using Python's built-in types and standard library. The engineer is not expected to design complex systems or advanced concurrency but should understand basic control flow, functions, modules, and how to safely read and write data. Under the guidance of senior developers, they should be able to write clean, maintainable code, handle common patterns like list comprehensions and context managers, and work within an already established codebase without modifying core architecture.","questions_prompt":"Please ensure the interview questions evaluate the candidate's ability to work with Python at a foundational level:\n\n- **Core Language and Data Structures**: The candidate should be able to use built-in types (lists, dicts, sets, tuples), write loops and conditionals, define functions, and understand basic OOP (classes, instances, simple inheritance).\n\n- **Working with APIs or Web Frameworks**: They should demonstrate familiarity with writing simple routes or handlers (e.g., Flask/FastAPI), handling request/response, and basic HTTP concepts.\n\n- **File and Data Handling**: The candidate should know how to read/write files, parse JSON or CSV, and use basic error handling (try/except) for common I/O and validation cases.\n\n- **Handling Errors and Edge Cases**: They should be able to explain how to manage common issues such as invalid input, missing keys, type errors, and when to use exceptions vs. defensive checks.\n\n- **Working Safely in an Existing Codebase**: The candidate should show the ability to extend existing modules, follow PEP 8 and project conventions, and make small improvements without disrupting the application's structure.\n\nThe goal is to gauge whether the candidate can reliably contribute to everyday backend tasks involving Python while following good development practices suitable for a beginner-level engineer.","yoe":"1-2"}
