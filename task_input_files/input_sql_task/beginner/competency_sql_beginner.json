They can form elementary ANSI SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and show minimal exposure to DDL (CREATE, DROP) and DCL (GRANT, REVOKE). They retrieve data from a single table, apply simple WHERE conditions, utilize ORDER BY for sorting, and use LIMIT/FETCH to control result size. They know basic data types like INT, VARCHAR/TEXT, DATE/TIME, and DECIMAL, with just enough understanding of how these affect queries. They connect to databases through tools such as MySQL Workbench, psql, SQL Server Management Studio, or Oracle SQL Developer, recognizing that RDBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle) have slight dialect differences (T-SQL, PL/pgSQL, etc.). They read simple syntax or constraint errors and correct issues like missing semicolons or mismatched quotes. They grasp fundamental best practices, including caution with SELECT * and the necessity of WHERE clauses to prevent accidental mass operations. They understand basic backup concepts and the importance of avoiding destructive queries in production environments. They have minimal knowledge of indexing and performance tuning, aware only that these concepts exist. They can articulate how SQL is used for straightforward data retrieval or simple business tasks. They also have some awareness of ORM frameworks like Hibernate or Entity Framework but do not use them actively."}]
