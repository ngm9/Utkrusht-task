They should be able to write SELECT statements with WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT, understand tables, primary and foreign keys, and write basic JOINs between two tables. They may use simple aggregates (COUNT, SUM, AVG) and GROUP BY. They run queries using a database client (e.g. psql, pgAdmin, DBeaver) and fix simple syntax errors. They are not expected to design schemas, optimize performance, or use advanced features; the focus is on correct, readable queries for reporting or data retrieval under guidance.","questions_prompt":"Please ensure the interview questions evaluate the candidate's ability to work with SQL at a foundational level:\n\n- **Basic queries**: The candidate should write SELECT with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, and understand filtering and sorting on one or two columns.\n\n- **Tables and keys**: They should understand tables, rows, columns, primary keys, and foreign keys, and how they relate in a simple schema.\n\n- **JOINs**: They should be able to write simple JOINs between two tables (e.g. one join condition) and interpret results.\n\n- **Aggregates**: They should use COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX and GROUP BY on a single column for simple reporting.\n\n- **Running queries**: They should be comfortable using a database client (psql, pgAdmin, DBeaver, or similar) and interpreting basic error messages.\n\nThe goal is to gauge whether the candidate can write correct, simple SQL for data retrieval and basic reporting suitable for a beginner-level role.","yoe":"0-1"}
