They understand primary keys, foreign keys, and simple data types, and can write INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE for routine data operations. They have foundational knowledge of indexing: why indexes exist, single-column indexes on frequently queried or join columns, and the idea that missing indexes can cause slow queries. They can use EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) to see execution plans and distinguish basic sequential scans from index scans. They understand NULL handling and basic WHERE-clause optimization. They work with 2-4 table schemas, simple one-to-many relationships, and can identify obvious performance issues (e.g. full table scans on large tables). They are not yet expected to design complex schemas, tune advanced queries, use window functions or CTEs routinely, or handle replication and production operations. Their experience is suitable for maintaining and improving existing databases and writing correct, reasonably efficient queries under guidance."}]
