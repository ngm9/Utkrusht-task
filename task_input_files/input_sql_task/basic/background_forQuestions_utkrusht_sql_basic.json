They should be comfortable with SELECT, JOINs across 2–3 tables, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, GROUP BY, and aggregates, and understand primary and foreign keys and basic data types. They should have foundational knowledge of indexing: when to add single-column indexes on frequently queried or join columns, and how missing indexes can cause slow queries. They can use EXPLAIN to read execution plans and distinguish sequential scans from index scans. They can identify and fix simple performance issues and write correct, maintainable SQL. They are not expected to design complex schemas or lead database architecture; the focus is on correct, reasonably efficient queries and basic optimization under guidance.","questions_prompt":"Please ensure the interview questions assess the candidate's ability to work with SQL at a basic level (1–2 years):\n\n- **Queries and JOINs**: The candidate should write SELECT with WHERE, JOINs (2–3 tables), ORDER BY, LIMIT, GROUP BY, and aggregates, and understand NULL handling.\n\n- **Schema and keys**: They should understand tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and simple data types, and how they affect queries and integrity.\n\n- **Indexing**: They should explain when and why to add indexes, single-column indexes on frequently queried columns, and the impact of missing indexes on performance.\n\n- **EXPLAIN and optimization**: They should use EXPLAIN (or EXPLAIN ANALYZE) to interpret execution plans, distinguish sequential vs index scans, and identify obvious bottlenecks (e.g. full table scans on large tables).\n\n- **Correctness and maintenance**: They should write correct, readable SQL for reporting or data operations and follow existing naming and style conventions.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can write correct, reasonably efficient SQL and apply basic optimization techniques suitable for a basic-level role.","yoe":"1-2"}
