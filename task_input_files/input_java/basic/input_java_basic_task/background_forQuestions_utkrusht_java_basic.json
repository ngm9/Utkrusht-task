     "role_context": "A software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Java is expected to write features accurately and efficiently while following standard coding and design practices. They should be comfortable working with Java’s core libraries, collections, and basic concurrency utilities. The engineer will have guidance from senior developers for system design and architecture decisions, but should be capable of implementing small to medium modules, writing clean code, and handling simple asynchronous tasks independently.",
    "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Concurrency, Asynchronous Patterns, and Performance in the context of Java:\n\n- **Basic Asynchronous Programming Understanding**: The candidate should demonstrate a foundational understanding of when and how to use Java’s asynchronous tools such as Threads, Runnable, ExecutorService, and CompletableFuture. They should know the purpose of asynchronous programming and be able to identify common issues like race conditions and thread safety at a basic level.\n\n- **Implementing Simple Background Tasks**: The candidate should be able to explain or implement background operations in Java that prevent blocking the main thread — for example, using ExecutorService for simple async workflows, or scheduling background jobs with ScheduledExecutorService. They should understand how to manage tasks that run independently of user requests.\n\n- **Basic Performance Awareness**: The candidate should understand how inefficient loops, unnecessary blocking operations, or poor resource handling can affect performance. They should be aware of good coding habits such as closing resources, avoiding unnecessary synchronization, and using appropriate data structures to improve efficiency.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can apply basic concurrency and asynchronous programming principles in Java to write efficient, safe, and maintainable code under supervision.",
