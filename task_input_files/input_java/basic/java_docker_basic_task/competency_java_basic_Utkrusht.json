        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Java as a competency should be able to understand the Java execution model (JDK, JRE, JVM) and write maintainable code using proper packages and naming conventions. They possess foundational proficiency in Java syntax, including control flow, error handling, and basic class structures. Their knowledge of OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) allows them to create coherent classes with appropriate access modifiers. They are comfortable employing Java’s core collections (List, Set, Map), grasping performance impacts of ArrayList vs LinkedList and HashMap vs TreeMap. They handle exceptions using try-catch-finally and appreciate the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions. Their concurrency awareness extends to creating and running simple threads, with a limited understanding of race conditions and synchronization. They can effectively use IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse), basic build tools (Maven, Gradle), and version control (Git) for daily tasks and collaboration. They have exposure to simple frameworks or libraries like JDBC for database connectivity, JUnit for testing, and minimal Spring Boot configurations. They follow introductory best practices such as organizing code, avoiding duplication, and adhering to naming standards, with an initial grasp of SOLID principles. They can debug code using IDE breakpoints, write straightforward test cases, and refactor small code snippets to address performance or readability concerns. They have participated in at least one small Java project, handled feature development, bug fixes, and engaged in code reviews. Their approach to software development involves basic Agile or similar methodologies, ensuring they can communicate effectively within a team."

        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Docker as a competency should be able to explain OS-level virtualization vs. VMs/processes, outline Docker’s architecture (CLI, daemon, REST API, image store, registry, storage & network drivers) and relate images, containers, volumes, networks, namespaces, cgroups and capabilities. They author efficient Dockerfiles using FROM, RUN, COPY, ADD, WORKDIR, ENV, ARG, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE, USER, LABEL, VOLUME, HEALTHCHECK, STOPSIGNAL, ONBUILD, optimise layer order, respect .dockerignore and perform single- or simple multi-stage builds. They tag, re-tag, pull, push, sign and digest-verify images, inspect layers and reclaim space by pruning dangling artefacts. They run/start/stop/restart/kill/attach/remove containers with flags for ‑p, ‑v, ‑e, device access, restart policies, --memory, --cpus and ulimits. They cp files, tail logs, exec shells, enter PID namespace, inspect metadata/stats/events and select restart policies (always, on-failure, unless-stopped). They create/manage bind, anonymous and named volumes via local, NFS or cloud drivers, handle permissions and SELinux/AppArmor labels and contrast ephemeral vs. durable data. They configure default and user-defined bridge networks, host mode, port mapping, embedded DNS, know macvlan/overlay options and inspect or prune networks. Using docker-compose v2/v3 they define services, build contexts, depends_on, volumes, networks, env substitution, profiles/overrides and convert stacks to CLI for single-host orchestration. Security hygiene includes non-root USER, capability drop/add, resource limits, scanning with Docker Scout/Trivy, secure config.json credentials and secret management beyond plain ENV. Troubleshooting employs docker logs, systemd journal, docker events, exit codes, HEALTHCHECK, container stats, resolving port clashes, permission issues, DNS faults or cache invalidation and pruning safely. They integrate Docker into local dev with bind-mount live reload, automate CI build-tag-push-test via Makefile/scripts, document image contracts and know when to escalate advanced needs like multi-host orchestration, overlay networking, rootless mode or deep performance tuning."
