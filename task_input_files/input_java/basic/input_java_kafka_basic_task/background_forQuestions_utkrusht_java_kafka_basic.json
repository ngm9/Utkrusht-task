    "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Concurrency, Asynchronous Patterns, and Performance in the context of Java and Kafka:\n\n- **Asynchronous Programming Proficiency**: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of when and why to use Java's asynchronous utilities (e.g., CompletableFuture, Executor frameworks) and Kafka's non-blocking producer/consumer patterns. They should be able to handle common async pitfalls such as race conditions, thread safety issues, callback hell, and proper exception handling in asynchronous operations.\n\n- **Managing Background Workflows**: The candidate should be able to design or integrate background message processing using Kafka consumers for tasks like email notifications, audit logging, or third-party API integrations that don't block the main application flow. These can be implemented using Kafka topic subscriptions, Spring Boot's @KafkaListener, or scheduled background jobs with proper error handling and retry mechanisms.\n\n- **Recognizing and Addressing Performance Bottlenecks**: They should be able to identify and improve performance issues such as blocking I/O operations in main threads, inefficient Kafka consumer configurations (poll intervals, batch sizes), memory leaks from unclosed resources, and suboptimal message serialization. They should understand how to optimize Kafka settings (producer batching, consumer group management), implement proper connection pooling, and use appropriate Java concurrency patterns for better throughput.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate how the candidate applies async and concurrent patterns in Java and Kafka environments, and handles distributed message processing efficiently using fundamental Java concurrency concepts."
