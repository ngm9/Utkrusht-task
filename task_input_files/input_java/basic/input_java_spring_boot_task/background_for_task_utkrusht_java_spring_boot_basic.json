        "role_context": "A software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Java and Spring Boot is expected to build simple REST APIs, work with common Spring Boot modules, and write clean, maintainable code. They should understand the basics of dependency injection, controllers, services, and configuration. While senior developers may guide architectural decisions, the engineer should be able to implement small features, handle basic CRUD operations, and work with simple asynchronous patterns provided by Spring. They should also follow standard Java coding conventions, use proper error handling, and write code that is easy to test.",
        
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover fundamental Spring Boot development, basic asynchronous handling, and simple performance considerations in the context of Java:\n\n- **Spring Boot Fundamentals**: The candidate should demonstrate basic understanding of creating REST endpoints using @RestController, handling requests/responses, working with service layers, and using dependency injection with @Autowired or constructor injection.\n\n- **Basic Asynchronous Patterns in Spring**: The candidate should be familiar with simple async execution in Spring using @Async or CompletableFuture for non-blocking operations. They should show awareness of when async behavior is useful and understand basic pitfalls like unhandled exceptions.\n\n- **Working With Data and CRUD Operations**: The candidate should understand how to work with Spring Data JPA (or similar libraries) for basic repository operations such as saving, updating, and fetching records.\n\n- **Simple Performance Awareness**: The candidate should understand how unnecessary blocking work, inefficient loops, or poor resource usage can affect application responsiveness. They should be able to explain basic good practices such as reusing beans, avoiding heavy work in controllers, and minimizing unnecessary object creation.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can build and maintain small Spring Boot features, use simple async capabilities responsibly, and write clean, readable Java code under supervision.",
