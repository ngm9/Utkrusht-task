  "role_context": "A software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Java is expected to independently design, implement, and optimize complex features that integrate with large-scale systems. They should have a strong grasp of advanced Java concepts, including concurrency, asynchronous programming, performance tuning, and memory management. They are expected to contribute to architectural discussions, propose scalable solutions, and mentor junior engineers while ensuring code quality, maintainability, and adherence to design principles. The engineer should be capable of identifying bottlenecks, improving throughput, and designing resilient systems that perform well under load.",

  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Concurrency, Asynchronous Patterns, and Performance Optimization in the context of Java:\n\n- **Advanced Concurrency and Multithreading**: The candidate should demonstrate deep understanding of Java concurrency utilities such as CompletableFuture, ExecutorService, ForkJoinPool, and parallel streams. They should be able to design thread-safe systems, explain synchronization mechanisms, identify and debug race conditions or deadlocks, and make trade-offs between concurrency and parallelism.\n\n- **Asynchronous Programming Expertise**: The candidate should be able to design non-blocking and asynchronous workflows using Java’s concurrency framework. They should understand how to use CompletableFuture chaining, handle exceptions in asynchronous pipelines, and discuss how to integrate asynchronous processing into large-scale applications while maintaining readability and error handling.\n\n- **Performance Profiling and Optimization**: The candidate should demonstrate hands-on experience with identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks, tuning the JVM (garbage collection, heap sizing), and optimizing thread pool configurations. They should know techniques to minimize blocking I/O, reduce latency, and effectively use tools like JVisualVM, Flight Recorder, or other profilers for performance analysis.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate how the candidate applies advanced concurrency and performance concepts in Java to build scalable, efficient, and maintainable systems.",
