        "name": "Java",
        "scope": "An **Intermediate Java developer (3-5 years)** should have a solid grasp of **OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)**, **Collections Framework (List, Set, Map, Queue)**, **Exception Handling**, **Multithreading (Executors, Synchronization, Locks)**, **File I/O (Streams, NIO)**, and **Java 8+ features (Lambdas, Streams, Optionals, Functional Interfaces)**. They should be proficient in **Spring Boot (Spring MVC, Security, Data)**, **Hibernate/JPA**, **RESTful APIs**, **JSON/XML parsing (Jackson, Gson)**, **Unit testing (JUnit, TestNG)**, **Dependency management (Maven, Gradle)**, and **Git version control**. They should understand **SQL (Joins, Indexing, Transactions, ACID)**, **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)**, **Design Patterns (Factory, Singleton, Strategy, Observer)**, and **SOLID principles**. Expected to troubleshoot with **IntelliJ/Eclipse Debugger, Profilers (JVisualVM, JProfiler)**, optimize performance, and resolve **memory leaks, thread contention, and deadlocks**. Should have experience in **CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)**, deploying apps on **Tomcat, Jetty, AWS/GCP/Azure**, and implementing **authentication (JWT, OAuth, Spring Security)** while following **secure coding practices (OWASP, XSS, CSRF protection)**. Should contribute to **code reviews, Agile workflows, documentation (Javadoc, Confluence)**, and collaborate with **QA, DevOps, and Product teams**. Can build and consume **RESTful APIs, integrate third-party services**, and optimize application **performance, memory management, and garbage collection**. Expected to work independently on **medium-complexity tasks** but lacks deep expertise in **JVM internals, distributed system design, Kubernetes, advanced cloud deployments**, and does not **architect large-scale applications** but can support them under guidance."

        "scope": "A person with INTERMEDIATE proficiency level in Docker as a competency should be able to model the full Docker Engine client-daemon-containerd-runc-BuildKit architecture, image layers and copy-on-write file systems; select and tune storage drivers (overlay2, aufs, btrfs, devicemapper, zfs), network drivers (bridge, host, overlay, macvlan, none) and logging drivers (json-file, journald, syslog, gelf, fluentd, splunk). They craft deterministic, multi-arch, multi-stage Dockerfiles using ARG, ENV, HEALTHCHECK, labels, .dockerignore, BuildKit #syntax, --mount, secrets, buildx and qemu-user while exploiting cache and reproducibility. They understand container security: minimal base images, non-root users, capability drop/add, seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux, user namespaces, rootless mode, Docker Content Trust or cosign signing, SBOM generation and CVE scanning with Trivy, Grype, Anchore or Clair. They implement data persistence with bind mounts, named volumes, tmpfs, NFS or CIFS, manage backups/restores and handle permissions across host boundaries. They configure resource limits (--cpus, --memory, --pids-limit, ulimits), restart policies, healthchecks, live-restore and daemon.json options, and read docker info, inspect, events, stats, diff, system df, system prune for capacity planning. They troubleshoot build/run/network/storage issues via docker logs/exec/cp, network inspect, volume inspect, ctr, nerdctl, strace, perf, top, nsenter, iptables/nftables and diagnose DNS, ingress vs host ports, hair-pin NAT and service discovery flows. They describe and deploy full stacks in Compose v2/v3 with networks, volumes, configs, secrets, overrides, rolling updates, scale commands and prototype Swarm fundamentals while knowing when to defer to Kubernetes. They run zero-downtime updates, volume migrations and log routing to centralized collectors using Fluent Bit, GELF or Splunk and export metrics through cAdvisor, Prometheus and Grafana. They integrate container workflows into CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps) with build cache, vulnerability gates, provenance signing and automated push to secure registries (Harbor, Artifactory, AWS ECR, GCR, ACR, Docker Hub) using credential helpers and mirrors. They enforce quality with hadolint, dockle, dive, crane and testcontainers, and mentor juniors on image size, efficiency and security conventions. They administer Docker on Ubuntu, CentOS/RHEL, Alpine using systemd and journalctl, plan safe engine upgrades/rollbacks and understand the interaction with the underlying OS kernel resources. They recognise limits: not yet designing multi-region, multi-cluster platforms or writing custom plugins, but fully autonomous in every first-class Docker feature and adjacent tooling for day-to-day production workloads."
