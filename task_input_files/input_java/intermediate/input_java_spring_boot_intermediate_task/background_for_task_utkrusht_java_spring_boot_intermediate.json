        "role_context": "A backend engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Java and Spring Boot is expected to design, build, and optimize robust backend services. They should have a strong understanding of layered architecture, Spring Boot modules, and production-oriented API development. The engineer is responsible for implementing complex features, applying best practices for performance and reliability, and contributing to architectural discussions. They should be comfortable working with Spring Data JPA, transaction management, validation, exception handling, and common Spring Boot integrations. The engineer is also expected to work with asynchronous processing, optimize critical paths, write well-structured tests, and ensure that their implementations are secure, scalable, and easy to maintain.",
        
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover intermediate Spring Boot concepts, deeper asynchronous processing, and performance-oriented backend design in Java:\n\n- **Advanced Spring Boot API Design**: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of layered architecture, DTO mapping, global exception handling, validation strategies, and building REST endpoints that follow production-grade patterns. They should show awareness of versioning, maintainability, and error modeling.\n\n- **Data Access, Transactions, and Query Efficiency**: The candidate should understand how to design entities, use Spring Data JPA effectively, write custom queries, and apply transaction boundaries correctly. They should recognize N+1 issues, lazy vs eager loading implications, and strategies for improving query performance.\n\n- **Intermediate Asynchronous and Event-Driven Patterns**: The candidate should be familiar with Spring @Async, CompletableFuture, schedulers, and event publishing mechanisms. They should understand how to offload heavy tasks safely and avoid blocking, race conditions, or thread pool misconfiguration.\n\n- **Performance, Caching, and Scalability Awareness**: The candidate should understand how to profile slow paths, apply caching using Spring Cache or Redis integrations, tune thread pools, and manage memory-heavy operations. They should also know basic strategies for improving throughput under load.\n\n- **Testing and Maintainability**: The candidate should demonstrate experience with unit testing, integration testing using Spring Boot Test, mocking frameworks, and writing assertions for async or transactional workflows.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can independently build scalable Spring Boot features, apply intermediate-level async patterns, reason about performance, and deliver maintainable, production-ready backend components.",
