        "scope": "A BASIC proficiency level individual in React should be able to create simple functional and class components using JSX and understand how to render static content. They should manage state and props to pass data between components, handle basic events like clicks and form submissions, and use React Router for simple navigation between views. They should set up new React projects using Create React App, manage dependencies with NPM or Yarn, and utilize code editors like Visual Studio Code. Understanding fundamental React concepts such as the component-based architecture, the Virtual DOM, and unidirectional data flow is essential. They should fetch and display data from external sources using the fetch API or Axios and perform basic debugging with console.log and browser developer tools. Possessing basic JavaScript ES6+ skills (like let/const, arrow functions, and array methods), along with fundamental HTML and CSS knowledge for styling components, is required. They should organize components logically, understand component reusability, and participate in team collaboration through basic Git operations and code reviews. Awareness of simple testing practices using tools like Jest, basic accessibility principles, and responsive design is also expected, along with a willingness to learn from more experienced team members."

        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in React Optimization as a competency should be able to understand the difference between performance and correctness, perceived vs. raw performance, and the fundamentals of React’s Virtual DOM, reconciliation, and rendering behavior. They should recognize common bottlenecks such as unnecessary re-renders from state/props/context changes, large lists, and heavy computations in render, and know the impact of state placement (local, lifted, context, global stores like Redux/Zustand) on re-rendering. They should use stable keys in lists, avoid anti-patterns like inline functions/objects, and know basics of conditional rendering, windowing/virtualization (react-window, react-virtualized) for large lists. They should be able to apply React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback for simple memoization, understand their trade-offs, and avoid overuse. They should manage expensive operations by moving them out of render, use useEffect for side effects, and be aware of blocking the main thread. They should implement basic async data-fetching with useEffect, manage loading/error states, avoid redundant network calls, and be aware of caching, deduplication (React Query, SWR), and pagination/infinite scroll. They should make performance-aware styling/layout choices, avoid inline style objects and heavy CSS effects, and understand the impact of layout shifts. They should use React DevTools and browser DevTools (Network, Performance tabs), Lighthouse, and have awareness of Web Vitals (CLS, LCP, FID) for profiling and diagnostics. They should understand the basics of build tools (Webpack, Vite, Parcel), bundle size, tree-shaking, code-splitting (React.lazy, dynamic imports), and lazy loading. They should consider performance in manual and automated testing (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress, Playwright), test with large data, and document/report performance issues. They should participate in code reviews to spot anti-patterns, communicate concerns, document optimization decisions, follow team guidelines, and know when to escalate complex issues to senior engineers."
