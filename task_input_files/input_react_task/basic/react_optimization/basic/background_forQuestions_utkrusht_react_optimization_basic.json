  "role_context": "A software engineer with 1-2 years of experience in React and TypeScript is expected to build and maintain well-structured, reusable UI components. They should write clean, scalable code following good design practices and basic performance considerations. Senior engineers may guide them on larger architectural decisions.",
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Asynchronous Programming, Rendering Performance, and State Management in the context of React and TypeScript:  \n\n- **Asynchronous Programming Basics**: The candidate should show understanding of when and how to use `async/await` or Promises for tasks like fetching data from APIs (e.g., with `fetch` or libraries like `axios`). They should be aware of common pitfalls such as handling errors in async calls, avoiding memory leaks with `useEffect`, and updating state safely after asynchronous operations.\n\n- **State Management & Background Updates**: The candidate should understand how to manage component state using tools like React’s built-in `useState`/`useReducer` hooks or context. They should be able to explain how to trigger updates based on background events (such as user interactions or API responses) without causing unnecessary re-renders.\n\n- **Rendering & Performance Awareness**: The candidate should recognize basic performance issues like excessive re-renders, expensive computations inside components, or unoptimized lists. They should know simple optimization techniques such as using `React.memo`, `useCallback`, or `useMemo` where appropriate.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate how the candidate applies asynchronous patterns, manages state updates, and keeps React components efficient and responsive using TypeScript.",
