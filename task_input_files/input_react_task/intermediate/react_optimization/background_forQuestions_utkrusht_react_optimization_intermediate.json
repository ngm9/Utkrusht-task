  "role_context": "A software engineer with 2–4 years of experience in React and TypeScript is expected to independently design, build, and maintain reusable, maintainable UI components and features. They should apply sound component design principles, make informed decisions about state placement and data flow, and incorporate performance considerations into day-to-day development. They are expected to reason about trade-offs, refactor existing code for readability and efficiency, and collaborate with senior engineers on architectural decisions rather than relying on constant guidance.",
  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions assess the candidate’s ability to reason about asynchronous workflows, rendering performance, and state management in React and TypeScript:\n\n- **Asynchronous Programming & Side Effects**: The candidate should demonstrate a clear understanding of async/await and Promise-based workflows for API communication (using `fetch`, `axios`, or similar libraries). They should be able to explain error handling strategies, request cancellation, and safe state updates in asynchronous flows, including preventing race conditions and memory leaks in `useEffect` and custom hooks.\n\n- **State Management & Background Updates**: The candidate should understand how to model and manage state using `useState`, `useReducer`, and context, and know when external state management or data-fetching libraries may be appropriate. They should be able to explain how background updates (such as API responses, polling, or user-driven events) propagate through the component tree, and how to minimize unnecessary re-renders through proper state structuring and memoization.\n\n- **Rendering & Performance Optimization**: The candidate should be able to identify and reason about common rendering performance issues such as redundant re-renders, inefficient dependency usage, and expensive synchronous work during render. They should explain and apply optimization techniques including `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo`, and articulate the trade-offs involved rather than applying them blindly.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate how effectively the candidate applies asynchronous patterns, structures and updates state, and optimizes rendering behavior to build responsive, maintainable React applications using TypeScript.",
