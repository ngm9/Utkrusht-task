"role_context":"A developer with 0–1 year of experience or taking first steps in React is expected to build simple UI components and small features with guidance. They should use functional components with hooks, pass and use props, manage simple local state with useState, handle basic events (onClick, onChange), and render conditionally or list data with map. They are not yet expected to design architecture, optimize performance, or work with advanced patterns; the focus is on correct use of core React concepts and completing well-scoped tasks.",
"questions_prompt":"Please ensure the questions assess the candidate's ability at React beginner level (0–1 year or first steps) only: - **JSX & Component Structure**: The candidate should be able to write valid JSX, structure a simple functional component, and use basic React patterns (returning elements, wrapping in fragments or a single parent). - **Props**: The candidate should understand passing props from parent to child, reading props inside a component, and using them for display or simple logic. - **Simple State with useState**: The candidate should use useState for a single value or a simple list, update state in response to user actions, and avoid mutating state directly. - **Basic Event Handling**: The candidate should attach handlers (onClick, onChange) and update UI or state based on user input in a simple way. - **Conditional Rendering & Lists**: The candidate should show/hide UI based on a condition and render lists with map, using a stable key for list items. The goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can implement or fix a small, well-defined feature using these introductory React concepts—without requiring TypeScript, useReducer, context, or performance optimizations (React.memo, useCallback, useMemo).",
