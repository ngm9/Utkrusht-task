        "scope": "A person with INTERMEDIATE proficiency level in Docker as a competency should be able to model the full Docker Engine client-daemon-containerd-runc-BuildKit architecture, image layers and copy-on-write file systems; select and tune storage drivers (overlay2, aufs, btrfs, devicemapper, zfs), network drivers (bridge, host, overlay, macvlan, none) and logging drivers (json-file, journald, syslog, gelf, fluentd, splunk).  \nThey craft deterministic, multi-arch, multi-stage Dockerfiles using ARG, ENV, HEALTHCHECK, labels, .dockerignore, BuildKit #syntax, --mount, secrets, buildx and qemu-user while exploiting cache and reproducibility.  \nThey understand container security: minimal base images, non-root users, capability drop/add, seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux, user namespaces, rootless mode, Docker Content Trust or cosign signing, SBOM generation and CVE scanning with Trivy, Grype, Anchore or Clair.  \nThey implement data persistence with bind mounts, named volumes, tmpfs, NFS or CIFS, manage backups/restores and handle permissions across host boundaries.  \nThey configure resource limits (--cpus, --memory, --pids-limit, ulimits), restart policies, healthchecks, live-restore and daemon.json options, and read docker info, inspect, events, stats, diff, system df, system prune for capacity planning.  \nThey troubleshoot build/run/network/storage issues via docker logs/exec/cp, network inspect, volume inspect, ctr, nerdctl, strace, perf, top, nsenter, iptables/nftables and diagnose DNS, ingress vs host ports, hair-pin NAT and service discovery flows.  \nThey describe and deploy full stacks in Compose v2/v3 with networks, volumes, configs, secrets, overrides, rolling updates, scale commands and prototype Swarm fundamentals while knowing when to defer to Kubernetes.  \nThey run zero-downtime updates, volume migrations and log routing to centralized collectors using Fluent Bit, GELF or Splunk and export metrics through cAdvisor, Prometheus and Grafana.  \nThey integrate container workflows into CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps) with build cache, vulnerability gates, provenance signing and automated push to secure registries (Harbor, Artifactory, AWS ECR, GCR, ACR, Docker Hub) using credential helpers and mirrors.  \nThey enforce quality with hadolint, dockle, dive, crane and testcontainers, and mentor juniors on image size, efficiency and security conventions.  \nThey administer Docker on Ubuntu, CentOS/RHEL, Alpine using systemd and journalctl, plan safe engine upgrades/rollbacks and understand the interaction with the underlying OS kernel resources.  \nThey recognise limits: not yet designing multi-region, multi-cluster platforms or writing custom plugins, but fully autonomous in every first-class Docker feature and adjacent tooling for day-to-day production workloads."
