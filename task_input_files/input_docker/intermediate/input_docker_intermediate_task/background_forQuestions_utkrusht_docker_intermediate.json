    "role_context": "An intermediate Docker engineer with 3–5 years of experience is expected to independently design, build, and operate production-grade containerized applications using the full Docker Engine stack and its core features. They take ownership of image creation, security hardening, storage and networking choices, and Compose-based multi-service environments, ensuring deterministic builds, efficient images, and reliable runtime behavior. They are responsible for integrating Docker into CI/CD pipelines, implementing observability and centralized logging, and handling zero-downtime deployments, upgrades, and migrations with minimal supervision. They are also expected to troubleshoot complex runtime, networking, and storage issues, advise teams on Docker best practices, and mentor junior engineers, while deferring platform-level, multi-cluster design decisions to more senior staff.",
    "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover\\n- **Architecture & Core Engine Operations**: Ability to explain the Docker Engine architecture (client, daemon, containerd, runc, BuildKit), image layers and copy-on-write behavior, and to interpret key diagnostics (docker info/inspect/events/stats/diff/system df/system prune) for capacity planning and troubleshooting.\\n- **Image Building, Multi-Stage Dockerfiles & Reproducibility**: Skill in writing efficient, deterministic, multi-stage and multi-arch Dockerfiles (ARG, ENV, HEALTHCHECK, labels, .dockerignore, BuildKit #syntax, --mount, secrets, buildx, qemu-user), optimizing build cache usage, and enforcing quality with tools like hadolint, dockle, dive and crane.\\n- **Runtime Configuration, Storage, Networking & Logging**: Competence in selecting and tuning storage drivers (overlay2, aufs, btrfs, devicemapper, zfs), network drivers (bridge, host, overlay, macvlan, none), and logging drivers (json-file, journald, syslog, gelf, fluentd, splunk), configuring data persistence (bind mounts, named volumes, tmpfs, NFS, CIFS) including permissions and backup/restore, and routing logs to centralized collectors.\\n- **Security, Resource Management & Operations**: Understanding of container security practices (minimal images, non-root users, capabilities, seccomp, AppArmor, SELinux, user namespaces, rootless mode, Docker Content Trust or cosign, SBOM generation, CVE scanning with Trivy/Grype/Anchore/Clair), configuring runtime limits and policies (--cpus, --memory, --pids-limit, ulimits, restart policies, healthchecks, live-restore, daemon.json), and administering Docker on common Linux distros using systemd and journalctl.\\n- **Orchestration, Compose, CI/CD & Troubleshooting**: Ability to model and deploy multi-service stacks with Docker Compose v2/v3 (networks, volumes, configs, secrets, overrides, rolling updates, scaling), describe basic Swarm usage and when to prefer Kubernetes, integrate Docker into CI/CD pipelines (build cache, vulnerability gates, provenance signing, secure registries and credential helpers), and troubleshoot build/run/network/storage issues using docker logs/exec/cp, network/volume inspect, ctr/nerdctl, nsenter, iptables/nftables, and related tools.\\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can autonomously design, secure, operate, and troubleshoot production-grade Docker-based workloads using the full range of first-class Docker features and common ecosystem tools at an intermediate level.",
