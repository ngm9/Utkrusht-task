    "role_context": "At the BASIC level, a software engineer with 1–2 years of Docker experience is expected to build and run containerized applications reliably on a single host under the guidance of more senior engineers. They will author and maintain efficient Dockerfiles, manage images, containers, volumes, and networks, and use docker-compose for straightforward multi-container setups in development and simple production-like environments. They are responsible for applying standard security hygiene, basic resource limits, and troubleshooting common runtime issues using logs, events, health checks, and stats. While they work mostly from established patterns and team standards, they should be able to integrate Docker into local development and CI pipelines independently and know when to escalate more advanced orchestration or networking requirements.",
    "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover:\\n- **Core Concepts & Architecture**: Ability to explain OS-level virtualization vs. VMs and regular processes, outline Docker’s architecture (CLI, daemon, REST API, image store, registry, storage/network drivers) and correctly relate images, containers, volumes, networks, namespaces, cgroups and capabilities.\\n- **Image Authoring & Management**: Ability to write efficient Dockerfiles using common instructions (FROM, RUN, COPY, ADD, WORKDIR, ENV, ARG, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, EXPOSE, USER, LABEL, VOLUME, HEALTHCHECK, STOPSIGNAL, ONBUILD), optimize layer order, respect .dockerignore, perform simple multi-stage builds, and manage images (tag/re-tag, pull/push, sign, verify digests, inspect layers, prune unused artefacts).\\n- **Container Lifecycle & Operations**: Ability to run and manage containers (run/start/stop/restart/kill/attach/rm), use key flags (-p, -v, -e, device access, restart policies, --memory, --cpus, ulimits), copy files, view logs, exec into containers, enter PID namespace, inspect metadata/stats/events, and choose appropriate restart policies.\\n- **Storage, Networking & Compose**: Ability to create and manage bind, anonymous and named volumes (local, NFS, cloud drivers), handle permissions and SELinux/AppArmor labels, distinguish ephemeral vs. durable data; configure default and user-defined bridge networks, host mode, port mappings, embedded DNS, and know when to use macvlan/overlay; and use docker-compose v2/v3 for defining services, build contexts, depends_on, volumes, networks, env substitution, profiles/overrides, and translating compose stacks to CLI for single-host use.\\n- **Security, Troubleshooting & Integration**: Ability to apply basic container security hygiene (non-root USER, capability drop/add, resource limits, image scanning tools like Docker Scout/Trivy, secure config.json credentials, secret handling beyond plain ENV), troubleshoot common issues (logs, events, exit codes, HEALTHCHECK, stats, port clashes, permissions, DNS, cache invalidation, safe pruning), and integrate Docker into local dev and simple CI workflows (bind-mount live reload, scripted/Makefile build-tag-push-test, documenting image contracts, and knowing when to escalate to more advanced orchestration or tuning).\\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can practically and safely use Docker at a basic level to build, run, manage, and troubleshoot containers in day-to-day development scenarios.",
