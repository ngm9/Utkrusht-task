    "role_context": "A software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Express.js is expected to build RESTful APIs and implement features accurately while following standard Node.js and Express.js development practices. They should be comfortable working with routing, middleware, and request/response handling. The engineer will have guidance from senior developers for architectural decisions but should be capable of implementing small to medium endpoints, writing clean and modular code, and handling basic asynchronous operations using promises or async/await independently.",

  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Asynchronous Programming, Middleware Design, and Performance in the context of Express.js:\n\n- **Basic Asynchronous Programming Understanding**: The candidate should demonstrate a foundational understanding of asynchronous programming in Node.js, including callbacks, promises, and async/await. They should understand how to handle errors in asynchronous code and avoid issues like callback nesting or unhandled promise rejections.\n\n- **Implementing Simple API Endpoints**: The candidate should be able to design and implement simple CRUD operations using Express.js, manage routes effectively, and use middleware for tasks such as input validation or logging. They should understand how to handle JSON payloads, route parameters, and basic request validation.\n\n- **Basic Performance and Error Handling Awareness**: The candidate should understand how blocking operations affect Node.js performance, the importance of using non-blocking I/O, and best practices such as using try/catch in async functions, setting appropriate HTTP status codes, and returning structured error responses.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can apply basic asynchronous programming and Express.js concepts to build reliable, maintainable, and well-structured API endpoints under supervision."
