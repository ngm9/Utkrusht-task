        "name": "ExpressJS",
        "scope": "An engineer at **INTERMEDIATE** proficiency in Express.js can independently design and deliver production-grade REST/JSON APIs and lightweight micro-HTTP services. They reliably structure applications around layered routing, modular middleware, centralised error-handling, and robust async / await control flow while maintaining 100 % callback-free code paths. Their toolkit covers Node 18 + LTS, npm / yarn workspaces, dotenv-driven configuration, ESLint + Prettier enforcement, and TypeScript compilation with ts-node or swc for dev loops. They integrate relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) or document (MongoDB) stores through query builders (Knex), ORMs (Prisma, Sequelize) or ODMs (Mongoose), applying connection pooling, transaction boundaries, and migration automation. Security hygiene is demonstrated via Helmet, CORS policy design, rate-limiting, input sanitisation, CSRF defence, and JWT or OAuth 2.0 flows implemented with Passport.js plus role-based access control guards. They expose self-documenting endpoints using OpenAPI 3 (swagger-jsdoc, swagger-ui) and version their APIs semantically. Automated test suites reach high line-coverage with Jest, Supertest, and in-memory database mocks, and are wired into CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) that also run type-checks, lint, and semantic-release. Performance tuning extends to compression, ETag handling, streaming large payloads, Redis-backed caching, and Node cluster or PM2 process managers under Docker or Kubernetes. They can containerise services, write multi-stage Dockerfiles, manage environment secrets, and deploy behind Nginx / Traefik reverse proxies on AWS, GCP, or Azure. Observability skills include structured logging with pino / winston, request tracing, Prometheus metrics, and basic alert rules in Grafana. Finally, they understand the Node event loop, memory profiling, and common pitfalls (blocked loop, unhandled rejections), enabling them to debug, benchmark, and refactor code for maintainability and scalability, though they have yet to master large-scale distributed patterns, domain-driven decomposition, or advanced performance forensics reserved for ADVANCED and EXPERT tiers."
