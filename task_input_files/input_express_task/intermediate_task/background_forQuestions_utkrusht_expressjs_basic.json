    "role_context": "A software engineer with 3–5 years of experience in Express.js is expected to independently design and implement complex backend systems and scalable RESTful APIs. They should have a deep understanding of Node.js event-driven architecture, middleware composition, and performance optimization techniques. The engineer should be able to structure projects efficiently, handle complex asynchronous workflows, ensure error resilience, and implement secure, production-ready APIs. They will also participate in architectural discussions, guide junior developers, and enforce coding and design best practices across the backend codebase.",

  "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Advanced Asynchronous Patterns, Middleware Architecture, and Performance Optimization in the context of Express.js:\n\n- **Advanced Asynchronous Programming Mastery**: The candidate should demonstrate deep understanding of asynchronous control flow in Node.js, including promise chaining, async/await patterns, and error propagation. They should be able to design non-blocking operations for heavy I/O tasks, integrate external APIs efficiently, and discuss handling concurrency safely in an event-driven environment.\n\n- **Building Scalable Middleware and Modular Architecture**: The candidate should be able to design modular Express.js applications, structure routes with controllers and services, and implement reusable middleware for tasks like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and logging. They should understand error-handling middleware patterns and how to separate business logic from routing layers.\n\n- **Performance, Security, and Reliability**: The candidate should understand how to optimize Express.js applications for performance (connection pooling, caching, load balancing), prevent common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF), and implement observability with monitoring tools. They should be able to identify performance bottlenecks caused by blocking I/O or inefficient middleware chaining and suggest solutions.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can apply advanced Express.js and Node.js principles to design scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems that meet production-grade requirements.",
