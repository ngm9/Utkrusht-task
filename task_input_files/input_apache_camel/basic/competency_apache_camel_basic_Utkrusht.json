        "name": "Apache Camel",
        "scope": "A person with BASIC proficiency level in Apache Camel as a competency should be able to explain what Apache Camel is, its role in system integration, and basic integration concepts such as producers, consumers, endpoints, messages, synchronous/asynchronous flows, and common message exchange patterns (InOnly/InOut). They should understand CamelContext, routes, endpoints, components (file, ftp/sftp, jms, http/https, kafka, timer, direct, seda), processors, and the basics of the Camel DSL (Java/XML/YAML) including constructs like from(), to(), log(), setBody(), setHeader(), choice(), filter(), split(), multicast, and wireTap. They should be familiar with Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) at a conceptual level (content-based router, message filter, splitter, aggregator, dead letter channel, recipient list, wire tap), and know how Camel implements them. They should be able to design and implement simple point-to-point routes, use beans/processors for transformations, apply property placeholders, and configure endpoints including authentication, timeouts, and SSL/TLS at a basic level. They should understand basic error handling (onException, doTry/doCatch, dead letter channel, redelivery policies, idempotentConsumer), and be able to route failed messages to error queues. They should be able to perform basic data transformations (setBody, setHeader, marshal/unmarshal with JSON, XML, CSV, use Simple language, JSONPath/XPath), and understand type conversion. They should be able to test and debug routes using CamelTestSupport, mock endpoints, adviceWith, and use logging, route tracing, and IDE debugging. They should be aware of performance implications of synchronous/asynchronous routes, large payloads, and concurrency (concurrentConsumers, throttler), and understand resource constraints in containerized environments. They should follow security best practices (not logging sensitive data, secure transports, externalized configuration, basic authentication/token handling, TLS/SSL config), and be aware of secrets management tools (Vault, KMS, Kubernetes secrets). They should be able to use build tools (Maven/Gradle), configure properties, run Camel apps locally, and use IDE support, as well as understand basic deployment models (standalone, Spring Boot, Quarkus, Camel K, Docker, Kubernetes). They should write maintainable, well-documented routes, participate in code reviews, collaborate with other roles, follow team standards, and contribute to documentation and runbooks for operational support."
