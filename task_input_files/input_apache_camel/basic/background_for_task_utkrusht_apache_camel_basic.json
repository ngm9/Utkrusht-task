        "role_context": "A software engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Java and basic exposure to Apache Camel is expected to work on simple integration flows and maintain existing routes. They should understand the fundamentals of Camel routing concepts—endpoints, processors, basic EIPs, and route configuration—while being able to implement small updates under guidance. The engineer should be comfortable using Camel components for common tasks (HTTP, file, timer, JMS/kafka if provided), applying simple transformations, and handling basic success/error scenarios. They are not expected to design large integration architectures but should be able to read routes, extend them safely, and ensure clean, maintainable code that fits into existing integration pipelines.",
      
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover foundational Apache Camel concepts, basic route creation, and simple integration patterns:\n\n- **Camel Routing Basics**: The candidate should demonstrate an understanding of what routes are, how Camel consumes and produces messages, and how to define simple flows using the Java DSL or XML DSL.\n\n- **Core EIPs (Enterprise Integration Patterns)**: The candidate should know basic patterns such as Filter, Choice, Split, and simple Routing Slip. They should understand when these patterns are useful in real integration scenarios.\n\n- **Using Camel Components**: The candidate should understand how to work with common components like `file:`, `http:`, `timer:`, or a simple messaging component. They should know how endpoints are configured and how messages flow through them.\n\n- **Basic Error Handling**: The candidate should be familiar with handling simple errors using Camel’s OnException or default error handler, and understand what happens when a route fails.\n\n- **Simple Transformations**: The candidate should know how to perform basic message transformations using processors, simple expressions, or built-in Camel DSL helpers.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can read, extend, and build simple Apache Camel routes, apply basic routing patterns, and integrate with common components while maintaining clean and predictable behavior.",
