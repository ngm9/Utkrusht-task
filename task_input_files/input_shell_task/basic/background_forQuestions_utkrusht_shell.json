        "role_context": "A DevOps or backend engineer with 1–2 years of experience in Shell scripting is expected to write simple and reliable scripts to automate routine system or deployment tasks. They should be comfortable working in Linux or Unix environments, using command-line tools, and understanding basic file operations, process management, and permissions. The engineer should be able to create small automation scripts for tasks such as organizing logs, monitoring disk usage, managing backups, or automating application start/stop processes. While senior engineers may guide them for more complex workflows, they should be capable of writing clean, well-structured, and tested scripts independently to handle common system operations safely and efficiently.",
        
        "questions_prompt": "Please ensure the questions you ask cover Automation, File Management, and Process Handling in the context of Shell scripting:\n\n- **Basic Scripting Fundamentals**: The candidate should demonstrate understanding of how to write and execute basic shell scripts using Bash or sh. They should know how to declare variables, use loops, conditionals, and functions to structure scripts logically.\n\n- **File and Directory Operations**: The candidate should be able to automate tasks such as copying, moving, archiving, or deleting files. They should understand how to use commands like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `find`, `grep`, and `tar`, and apply redirection and piping effectively.\n\n- **Process and Task Automation**: The candidate should understand how to schedule recurring jobs using cron, monitor running processes using commands like `ps` and `top`, and handle background tasks with operators like `&` and `nohup`.\n\n- **Error Handling and Logging**: The candidate should demonstrate awareness of exit codes, conditional checks, and how to log script output for debugging or monitoring. They should be able to handle cases like missing files or failed commands gracefully.\n\n- **Performance and Efficiency Awareness**: The candidate should understand the impact of inefficient loops or redundant commands, and know how to use simple optimizations such as command substitution or combining operations into fewer steps to improve runtime efficiency.\n\nThe goal is to evaluate whether the candidate can write clear, functional, and maintainable shell scripts to automate everyday operational tasks, handle files and processes safely, and apply basic system scripting best practices under supervision.",
